This article came to me at a perfect time. I don't really know how I found it, but last week was difficult. I felt useless and like a fraud. This post instead helped me concentrate on all the great things I do, how valuable I am as a designer and developer, and that even if all that wasn't true, I have an amazing wife and family who love me deeply. Maybe you're in need of the same reminder?
