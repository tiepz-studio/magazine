*Jessica Jones* and *The Punisher* are the last Marvel Netflix shows to be canceled [according to *Deadline*](https://deadline.com/2019/02/the-punisher-jessica-jones-canceled-netflix-marvel-krysten-ritter-jon-bernthal-1202535835/). The third season of Jessica Jones will still air, but no official release date has been announced yet.

At this point, I expected Netflix to cancel these too. I'm confused by the why, but I think [this article on *Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/02/19/netflix-daredevil-punisher-jessica-jones-disney-hulu-iron-fist-luke-cage-captain-marvel/#6b76a0463b68) makes a solid argument.

[I've been hoping they revive these characters on Disney+](/2018/11/daredevil-canceled-by-netflix-after-3-seasons/), but according to some [reporting by Joe Otterson for Variety](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/defenders-disney-streaming-daredevil-iron-fist-luke-cage-jessica-jones-1203087219/), it seems that would have to wait:

> Sources tell *Variety* that the deal for the original four Marvel shows includes a clause that prevents the characters from appearing in any non-Netflix series or film for at least two years after cancellation.

*Daredevil*, *Luke Cage*, nor *Iron Fist* could be on any streaming service until 2020. *Jessica Jones* would have to wait longer. I'm unsure whether they can begin production before then (as long as it doesn't air before the cool off period), or if the specifics of the deal prevent them from working on these shows at all.

In the end, I think this whole thing will be for the best. It's always better to own your content and have final say as to where it lives and how it's distributed.
