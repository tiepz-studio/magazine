From Emojipedia:

> When Apple [first released](https://blog.emojipedia.org/ios-12-1-beta-includes-new-emojis/) the new emoji support in iOS 12.1 beta 2, many were quick to criticize the bagel. “What midwestern bagel factory did this bagel come out of?” [asked Nikita Richardson](http://www.grubstreet.com/amp/2018/10/whats-going-on-with-apples-new-bagel-emoji.html) of Grub Street.

First of all, I take offense to the slight at midwestern bagels. How dare you? There are plenty of amazing places to get a bagel here. Second, they called this bagel-emoji-gate! The "-gate" term has been so diluted at this point that it means next to nothing.
