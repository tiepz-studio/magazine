Yes, this *is* the app you’ve been looking for. Using it is incredibly easy, and forget having to search for the tab the Google Hangout is on, wait for controls to appear on hover,[^hover] then finally unmute. By this time, your co-workers are convinced you’ve either disconnected or weren’t paying attention.

Do yourself and your reputation a favor. [Buy this app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shush-microphone-manager/id496437906?mt=12).

[^hover]: C'mon Google, get your stuff together.
