Dave wrote this the day I went to Vegas and I haven't had time to write about it.

> Let’s say you’re making a blog post layout. Content is entered into a CMS inside a WYSIWYG editor field. You echo that content to the page. You pull it up on a mobile device and notice the paragraphs go edge-to-edge. Yikes, it’s a little uncomfortable. So you add some kind of left/right padding maybe using a `div.container`.

Uncle Dave's solution for this is pretty great. Visually, this is the type of layout I wanted for this site. So in an exercise of self-shame, let's [look at the selector that makes it all work](https://github.com/smithtimmytim/theboldreport.net/blob/master/_assets/stylesheets/_layout/_maincontent.scss#L429)!

```scss
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
ol,
ul,
hr,
.post__header,
.post__footer,
.post__entry > p,
.search-results-list > p,
.page__entry > p,
.highlight,
.extendout figcaption,
.footnotes,
.pagination,
.site__footer small,
.author,
.fullwidth,
.page__search {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 90%;
  @media #{$large-up} {
    width: 65%;
  }
}
```

Ugh! What the hell is this Tim? Gross! How I ever thought this was an elegant solution, I don't know. But going back to what Dave says is perfectly illustrated in the code above. Using `:not()` allows you to only manage exceptions instead of all this. The actual elements that I want to "embiggen" as Dave calls it, are only a few. This selector would only contain around four or five exceptions.

Anyway, I need to put this on the list of things I need to rewrite for the next redesign.
