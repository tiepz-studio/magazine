Hello Dear Reader,

This past week was a sucky one for me. I got a cold. You know how it is when you get sick. You don't want to do anything but sleep. Well, that was basically my week.

I'm feeling better now, so you'll see some new writing on the site. I'm playing catch up so, you'll see some stories from last week I wasn't able to get to.

Hope you're having a great day, and as always, thank you for reading.
