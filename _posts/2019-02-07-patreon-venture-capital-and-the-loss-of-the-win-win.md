Cheri Baker on Patreon:

> Here we have a business that people like, offering a service we value, and it enables small businesses to grow, benefiting many people. That’s how business should work. But because Patreon took in a shit-ton of VC money, they don’t have the freedom to stay in *that* business. They have to chase more money, a *lot more*, just to stay afloat.

Cheri's right. The proof is in the pudding. If you're starting a business in tech, self-funding is the the way to go.
