I think “page building”, as it seems we’ve standardized the term, is broken when too many granular design elements are allowed. Instead, I’d like to see content building, where structured content can be created with a tool, but theming and styles are still left to, well, themes.

Lots of things I wanted to quote here, but just go read this. Brian, as per usual, gives excellent insights.
