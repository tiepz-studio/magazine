excerpt: People familiar with Apple’s plans tell *AllThingsD* that the company will
  hold its next invitation-only event on Tuesday, October 22. The focal point of the
  gathering will be the latest updates to the company’s iPad line, but the new Mac
  Pro and OS X Mavericks will likely get some stage time as well, I’m told.

I love Apple Event days. I never get anything else done.
