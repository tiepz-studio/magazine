Ina Fried reporting for *Recode*:

> LG has found a fix for a [problem](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439850/lg-ultrafine-5k-monitor-router-issues-apple) that left its [high-end Mac monitor](http://www.recode.net/2016/12/20/14024914/lg-5k-apple-monitor-delayed) unable to work properly when placed within a few feet of a router.

As it is, [the options in the display space are pretty slim](https://brightpixels.blog/2017/01/displays-for-designers-and-developers-bjango/), but now this? How embarrassing. With the experience LG has making monitors, it feels downright stupid. I hope this ordeal gets Apple to rethink it's departure from the display business.
