In this episode:

> Eryn O'Neil grew up in the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. When it came time for college, it was easy for her to move a few states over and go to college in a small town in Iowa. She now lives in Minneapolis, and after years of being self-employed, she just finished a months-long journey to find her next job.
>
> Eryn talks to me about being the first female engineering manager at her new company, what excites her about technology, the hurdles of married life, and staying healthy in a demanding industry.

I'm so excited this episode is out. Eryn came into my studio in Saint Paul to record in person, and I really feel that comes across in the coversation.
