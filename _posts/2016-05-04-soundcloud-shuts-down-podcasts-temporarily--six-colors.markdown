Jason Snell writing on *Six Colors*:

> I have no ill will toward SoundCloud, but they have never seemed to see podcasting as anything but a way to capture users and draw them in to their own ecosystem. Podcasting is a side business for SoundCloud, and linking to episodes of podcasts hosted by SoundCloud is usually a gigantic pain, because SoundCloud tries very hard to suppress file URLs. I don’t know whether they do it because they don’t get how podcasting works, or because they *do* get how podcasting works and want to try to break that approach so that people are driven to SoundCloud.

> In any event, I don’t recommend that podcasters use SoundCloud.

SoundCloud seems to be stupid. Some very big podcasts have trusted them with their catalog, but I can’t see that continuing with this attitude. Like Jason, I recommend using [a service that’s actually committed to podcasts](http://www.libsyn.com/).
