> The 6-foot-9 forward has looked like a potential steal in the draft for the Lakers, who picked him 27th overall with the first-rounder they acquired from the Brooklyn Nets in the D'Angelo Russell-Brook Lopez deal.
>
> While Ball garnered all the attention and won MVP honors at Las Vegas Summer League, Kuzma was a major surprise, as he averaged 21.9 points. 6.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, 1.1 steals and shot 48 percent from 3-point range.

Since Summer League, Kuzma keeps putting up great numbers. At this point, I'm honestly more excited about Kyle Kuzma than I am about Lonzo. That's not a dig on Lonzo, it's more about me loving to root for underdogs like this. Here's a kid that not many had heard about, and now he's the most talked about player on the Lakers roster. This could be his fifteen seconds of fame, or could be the start of a great career much like another Laker legend who wasn't picked in the top 5.
