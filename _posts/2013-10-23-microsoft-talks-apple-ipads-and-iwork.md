Frank Shaw on *The Official Microsoft Blog*:

>Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal.

Microsoft looks incredibly stupid for publishing this garbage.

Who cares that you made a device you think "is the most productive tablet you can buy today," when it's not selling? Eighty-one percent of tablet usage is on the iPad, and I highly doubt that the Surface has a significant share of the remaining nineteen percent.

Microsoft has so much untapped potential they could use for making great new products. Instead, they waste their time writing a post like this that claims they understand "how people work better than anyone else." Talk is cheap, but the fact is this: while Microsoft was busy loosing $900 million on Surface tablets in Q3 2013, Apple sold 14.6 million iPads.
