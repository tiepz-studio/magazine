George Gene Gustines reporting for *The New York Times*:

> Captain Marvel, one of the formidable heroines of the Marvel universe, will be getting a hero’s welcome in a new comic-book series that begins in January. The series, which will be written by [Kelly Thompson](https://twitter.com/79SemiFinalist) and drawn by [Carmen Carnero](https://twitter.com/CarmenCarnero), returns Captain Marvel to New York City after a stint in space as the first line of defense against alien threats.

> “You really want her to be accessible to new and younger audiences who are going to see the movie, fall in love and want to seek out other Captain Marvel stories,” Ms. Thompson said. “But you really want to respect the fans who have loved the character for decades. I think there’s a razor’s edge there.”

What amazing news! Kelly Thompson is one of my favorite comics writers right now, and Carmen Carnero has been absolutely killing it on *X-Men: Red*.

Update your pull lists people, *Captain Marvel* #1 goes on sale January 2, 2019.
