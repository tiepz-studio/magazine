For years, I've loved teaching what I learn. I believe it to be my duty to help others, as I've been helped. It's one of the main reasons I started *The Bold Report*, it's the reason I created [Tim Likes to Teach](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008052815/http://timlikestoteach.com/),[^timlikestoteach] and why I've told people for years that [my calendar is available to them](http://calendly.com/smithtimmytim).

Back in November, [Jim Cummins][1872-0001] invited me to give a flexbox workshop for his class at The Iron Yard. *I was hooked*. I knew I loved helping others learn how to build the web, but I wasn't sure how to keep doing it.

Enter [Bloc][1872-0002]. I first saw them because my friend [Niki Brown][1872-0003] was a mentor there. Bloc is an awesome group of people teaching web design and development. They have an excellent curriculum there, and assign a personal mentor to each student.

I'm excited to say that I joined them as a part-time mentor this week. I'll have a few students that I'll meet with, review assignments for, and mentor into becoming excellent contributors to our industry.

I want to give a huge thank you to [Chris Courtney][1872-0004], and the rest of the Bloc team for making me feel so welcome and valued. I have my first student appointments starting next week. I'm nervous interestingly, but looking forward to it!
