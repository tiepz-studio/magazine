Steve Aschburner on NBA.com:

> Five Cavaliers players scattered like roaches bugging out over a light bulb. Several Boston players stood still, crouched low or leaned in, incredulous at what they were seeing. In that instant, the guys over on the Cleveland bench – with the nearest and clearest view of Gordon Hayward’s hideously twisted left leg and ankle – recoiled, turning away in unison as if choreographed.

> It looked like the sort of Fred Sanford routine NBA players break out on All-Star Saturday, wincing and staggering in playful reaction to some dazzling dunk. Only this wasn’t theatrics, this was horrific. And their reactions were emotional, and real.

Five minutes into Gordon Hayward's debut for the Celtics, and he suffered [an injury that could possibly be season-ending](http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/19/boston-celtics-gordon-hayward-agent-says-surgery-went-well). Injuries happen in sports, but it's not everyday you see something like this. I've never suffered an injury on this scale, but I'm sure the first thing you think about is whether you'll be able to ever play again. Thankfully the injury seems to have been a clean break, and he'll recover just fine.

My heart goes out to Gordon Hayward, and I hope for a speedy recovery.
