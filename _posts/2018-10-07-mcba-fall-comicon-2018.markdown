subtitle: My first comic con
---

Stupidly, I didn't take any pictures while at my local comic con this weekend, but my goodness did I have a great time. Out of the five in our group who went, three of us had never been to an event like this.

I'm happy to report that it felt like I was in a large room of *my people*. The atmosphere was welcoming, and I quickly felt right at home admiring the art of some incredibly talented people who were displaying and selling their work. By the end of the day, I'd purchased quite a few prints that I'm excited to frame and hang on my walls.

Can't wait to be at [Spring Con 2019](https://www.mcbacomicons.com/) on May 18 & 19.
