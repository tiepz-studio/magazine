~~Hello peeps,~~

~~Just wanted to check in and let you know that I'll no longer be writing on this site regularly, if at all. I'm sad to say this, but I feel like it's the right decision. Writing here (and *The Bold Report*) has been a lot of fun and a lot of work, but this blog never took off the way I wanted it to.~~

~~And that's ok. So this is the end. Thank you for all your support over the years, and for reading. I will be focusing more on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/smithtimmytim), trying to produce great content over on [The Changelog](https://changelog.com), and audio journaling all about it on [The Radio Column](https://tiepz.com/podcasts/column/).~~

~~If you have thoughts, questions or concerns, feel free to send me an email at <smith@tiepz.com>.~~

~~Take care.~~
