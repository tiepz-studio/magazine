This past week, I was honored to be interviewed on Chris Martin's show, *Getting Work to Work*. Here's how Chris describes what we talked about:

> Lately, I’ve been getting into the habit of emailing strangers on the internet and asking them questions. Tim was one of the recipients of those emails. [He wrote a blog with his responses](http://www.chrismartinstudios.com/gwtw/interview-tim-smith-gwtw56/). Since he responded, I stayed in touch and was inspired to have him as a guest on *Getting Work To Work* after he posted about podcasting gear. In this interview episode, Tim and I talk about the web community, the importance of having a life outside of work, burnout, authenticity, and Star Wars. Please enjoy this interview with designer, front-end developer, and lover of Star Wars, Tim Smith.

I really enjoyed being on the show. I haven't been interviewed in a while actually. If you have a podcast and ever need a guest, I love being on podcasts. [Send me an email](mailto:smith@tiepz.com) and we can iron out the details.
