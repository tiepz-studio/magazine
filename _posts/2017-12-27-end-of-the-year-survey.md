Dear Reader,

The end of the year is upon us, and we've published 118 links and articles this year. Going into 2018, I'd like to have a better understanding of what content you love, what you could do without, and what you'd add.

With that in mind, I created the [Brightly Colored End of the Year Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/vePiRHriJRM2AlA22). It contains five questionsâ€”all of them optional. Thanks in advance to you awesome people who take it.

## Giveaway

For fun, I'm offering to give away [two shipments of 6oz. Blue Bottle coffee](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/at-home/gift) to two winners. Two different people, get two amazing shipments of coffee each. If you love coffee, I think you'll enjoy this.

## How to Win

- Fill out the survey and include your email address
- **I will not contact you for anything other than you winning, unless you give me explicit permission.**
- You have reside in [one of these contries to win](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/help/do-you-ship-to-my-country).
