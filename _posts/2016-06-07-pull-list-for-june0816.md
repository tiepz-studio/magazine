First off… let me come clean: I totally bought Civil War II last week. I really wasn’t going to because it is expensive, but I just couldn’t help myself. I’m so glad I bought it. Issue #1 of Civil War II is excellent. It sets up a story that I’m looking forward to seeing unfold.

Now, let’s get to books I’m picking up!

1. **All-New X-men #10** - I feel like I’m one of the few that are really enjoying this book. Many longtime X-men fans don’t particularly like this run, but it’s way better than watching that terrible X-men movie in the theater right now.
2. **Daredevil #8** - I’m a bit behind on Daredevil because I bought the trade, but it only had the first five issues. So I had to order issue #6 online, and I’m waiting for that one so I don’t miss anything.
3. **Wonder Woman Rebirth #1** - Wonder Woman is one of my favorite  all-time heroes. I’m really looking forward to getting into this run from the beginning.
4. **Flash Rebirth #1** - I caught the last two issues of the New 52 Flash, and I wasn’t impressed. I’m hoping this new run is better. If the DC Universe Rebirth issue is any indication, the Flash is at the center of the conflict so, it’ll be fun to read.
