Another NCBD (new comic book day) is upon us! Here’s what I read last week, and what I’m picking up this week! Also, you can follow me on [League of Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim) to see all of my subscriptions and my growing collection!

## What I read last week

- **X-23 #3**  
This book keeps gettin better and better. Mariko Tamaki really understands Laura and Gabby, and writes them excellently.
- **Daredevil Annual #1**  
The story centered more on Misty Knight, but that didn’t bother me at all! I enjoyed the issue.

**Favorite of the week:** X-23 #3

## Picking up this week

- **Deadpool #4**  
I’m not sure I like the way Young writes Deadpool, but still giving it a chance.
- **Cover #1**  
Interesting premise, so going to give it a try.
