Dan Cederholm on *A List Apart*:

>…the reality is that Sass (and other CSS preprocessors) can be a powerful ally—a tool that any style-crafter can easily insert into their daily work. It took me a while to come around, but I’m sure glad that I did.

We published a great excerpt from Dan's new book [*Sass for Web Designers*](http://www.abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers). Dan has been long regarded as one of the best when it comes to CSS, and I can't wait to finish reading this new book. If you're on the fence about whether to buy the book, this great excerpt might be just the thing to whet your appetite.
