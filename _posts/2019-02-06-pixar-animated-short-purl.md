This animated short has some critical social commentary and lands some hilarious jokes while doing it. Turns out, [the short is based on Director Kristen Lester's experience in animation](https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/4/18210951/purl-pixar-short-film-sparkshorts):

> My first job, I was like the only woman in the room, and so in order to do the thing that I loved, I sort of became one of the guys. And then I came to Pixar, and I started to work on teams with women for the first time, and that actually made me realize how much of the female aspect of myself I had sort of buried and left behind.
