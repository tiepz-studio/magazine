Jake Underwood writing for *MacStories*:

> Partly Sunny, like other paid weather apps, is loaded with data. At its most informative, the app will give you temperature (high, low, “feels like,” and current), precipitation chances, sunrise and sunset, cloud cover, humidity, visibility, and multiple charts and graphs. That sounds cluttered, but Partly Sunny’s interface is designed to only provide you as much information as you want for it to show.

[After David Smith discontinued Check the Weather](https://brightpixels.blog/2016/10/discontinuing-support-for-check-the-weather-by-david-smith/), I switched to Dark Sky. Dark Sky is full of a lot of great information, but its design is lack luster. [Partly Sunny](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/partly-sunny-weather-forecasts/id1104486867) is an app that uses all the great data from Dark Sky, and displays it beautifully!
