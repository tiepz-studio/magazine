Using Jekyll instead of a CMS like WordPress, means that some things aren't automated like before. With WordPress, when you publish a new post, the system automatically pings services around the web letting them know you've published new content.

We can use Rake to do this. If you use Jekyll together with FeedPress for your RSS Feed, this Gist helps you write a simple Rake task that interacts with the FeedPress API.

Easy peasy.
