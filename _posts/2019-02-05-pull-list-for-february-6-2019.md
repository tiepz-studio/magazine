Every Wednesday, all-new comic books hit the shelves with original stories to be engrossed in, and new art to be fascinated by. I didn't pick anything up last week, but this is what I'm buying this week.

## Picking up this week

- **Daredevil #1** - Chip Zdarsky's work (although not the writer) on *Sex Criminals* is just incredible, and I've heard many good things of his *Spectacular Spider-Man* run, so I'm excited to read his take on Daredevil. This is one of those characters I grew to love because of the Netflix series.
- **Deadpool #9** - I was going to drop *Deadpool* (not because it's bad, but to make room for other titles), but then I saw that he's teaming up with Jessica Jones. I can't miss this.
