Ben Brooks:

> When I last wrote about sit-stand electric desks, I took a look at the [Jarvis desk](https://brooksreview.net/2014/02/jarvis-standing-desk/) — at the time one of the cheapest desks you could get, while still getting a very quality product. I left that desk behind when I changed careers, and went without an electric desk for quite some time.

[I wrote my own review about a sit-stand desk](/2016/04/review-human-solution-uplift-desk/) earlier this year after buying one from the [Human Solution](http://www.thehumansolution.com). When I wrote that, I explicitly said:

> Price is the biggest hiccup when considering a standing desk. Here’s the thing: a standing desk is an investment. It’s an investment in your long-term health and well-being. Be prepared to spend at least $500.

Turns out, you can find something cheaper. And by the looks of it, without compromising on quality.
