Curtis McHale:

> When I’m paid weekly I’m not hoping that you’ll pay me in a timely manner. I was already paid for the week I’m working. So I’m not sweating cash-flow. I’m not trying to dig deep to get other clients and get them to pay deposits (while working for you) to keep that 40% I’m out flowing. I’m simply focused on providing you with value this week.

This model makes so much sense in client services.
