Cap Watkins:

> I was frequently out of touch with how strongly (or not strongly) I felt about a particular topic of discussion. Regularly, I’d find myself impassioned more towards the ten-out-of-ten side of things, mostly because I wasn’t stopping to think about the scope and importance of those topics.

My co-worker Loc, shared this link a few days ago. It's a great reminder that you shouldn't be arguing with your co-workers for the sake of arguing. Sometimes, you've got to stop, gather your thoughts, and if you don't have a strong opinion, trust the judgement of your teammate.
