It's that time again! New comics come out Wednesday, so here's what I read last week and what I'm picking up this week.

## What I read last week

- **Mr. & Mrs. X #3** - Love Kelly Thompson, but I'm just not feeling Rogue and Gambit as characters. Dropping this title at the end of the arc.
- **Return of Wolverine #1** - Really disappointed with this issue. I understand there needs to be setup for the arc, but there was so much setup, that we didn't actually learn anything. I also wasn't a fan of the art. The inking is very heavy.
- **West Coast Avengers #2** - This series is one of my favorites right now. I love the humor, and the dynamics of the team. Kate Bishop is a great character, and her moments with Clint were well written and endearing.
- **Saga Vol. 1** - Brian K. Vaughan can do no wrong. After reading his Paper Girls series and loving it, I heard Saga was good and should give it a try. Holy crap! This series is amazing. I love it! RIP to my wallet while I buy the other 8 volumes to catch up.

**Favorite of the week:** Saga Vol. 1

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #6** - New arc! I wasn't all that happy with how easy the last arc wrapped up, but Nick Spencer is overall doing an excellent job with this book. Sad to see Ryan Ottley won't be back on art till issue #11.
- **Jessica Jones #3** - Love how Kelly Thompson has been writing Jessica. This is the last issue of this arc, and I'll be picking up the trade when it comes out too.
- **X-Men: Red #8** - Seriously thinking of framing the cover of this issue. Laura looks badass. Tom Taylor keeps doing great with this title. I hope the other X-titles don't mess with this one.
