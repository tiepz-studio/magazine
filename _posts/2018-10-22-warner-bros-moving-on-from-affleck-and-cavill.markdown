Ian Cardona writing for *CBR*:

> Yesterday, a report by *[Variety](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/flash-standalone-movie-release-date-1202980356/)* surfaced confirming that the production of the long-gestating Flash movie starring Ezra Miller had been [delayed to late 2019](https://www.cbr.com/production-on-the-flash-stumbles-to-late-2019/). But that wasn’t the only important news to be found in the report.

> In fact, this report from Variety went on to confirm that Warner Bros. is effectively done with Affleck and Cavill. “The studio is not moving forward with Batman and Superman movies featuring Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, respectively,” the article reads. “It is expected to recast the Dark Knight with a different actor.”

What a shame. I mean, I don't blame both Warner Bros. or the actors for wanting to move on. Poor writing and a lack of critical success can really sour a role. Still, it's a shame because both Affleck and Cavill are great actors that weren't able to deliver great performances due to issues out of their control.

I sincerely hope that both Warner Bros. and DC start making films true to the wonderful pantheon of characters at their disposal instead of in comparison to what other studios are doing.
