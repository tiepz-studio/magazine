From NBA.com:

> In short, the Sixers and Okafor remain in limbo. ESPN.com's Adrian Wojnarowski caught up with Okafor and Sixers GM Bryan Colangelo to gauge their thoughts on the state of affairs. He reports that Colangelo has dropped his asking price for Okafor from two first-round picks to a first-round pick and a solid player to a second-round pick. Still, [the Sixers haven't been able to work out a trade for Okafor](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21581687/jahlil-okafor-philadelphia-76ers-limbo-hoping-resolution), which is frustrating the big man:
> > "This is my third year in the NBA, and I know it's a business. I don't know if it's fair or not, but in talking to other people in the NBA, talking to retired players, one thing I've heard them say is that what's going on with me isn't right and they've never seen anything like this before.

This is a disappointing situation. I find myself agreeing with Jahlil here, yes it's a business, but this devalues the player which will therefore affect the offers you get for him. Maybe it's because I've been paying closer attention to this stuff, but I feel like we've recently seen executives that are unprofessional.[^1] I think the Sixers mismanagement of this situation will be harmful for their organization in the long term.

[^1]: The cases of Eric Bledsoe and Carmelo Anthony are ones that come to my mind. Both are examples of executives not only being unprofessional, but very stupid. Both situations led to mediocre trades—where had they kept their trap shut—they could've received better offers.
