>What really makes the AeroPress such a great coffee maker is just how versatile it is. There are a lot of ways you can use it.

>For my cupboardfull of aforementioned coffee brewing contraptions, each one has only one best way to brew coffee. The AeroPress has at least three different ways to brew coffee: espresso-like, pourover-esque, and french press-ish. Each way is completely legitimate and delicious.

I love my AeroPress for the same reasons.
