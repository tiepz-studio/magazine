Chantal Panozzo sums up why she’s not completely excited to be living in the U.S. again:

> While I enjoy being close to family again, returning to the United States made me realize who I've become: someone who can't believe companies aren't required to pay into a pension fund beyond Social Security. Someone who is offended that most women in America don't have the maternity benefits she had.
> 
> And someone who is mad that she must own a car for lack of efficient public transportation. Someone who, because of all of this, is still debating where she ultimately wants to call home.

Such a fascinating read. Made me think about whether I’m living in the right place.
