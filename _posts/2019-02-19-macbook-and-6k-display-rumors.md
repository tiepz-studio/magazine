[Chance Miller writing for *9to5Mac*](https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/17/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-display-more/):

> Perhaps most notable are Kuo’s claims about the Mac lineup. According to the analyst, Apple will release a new MacBook Pro between 16-inches and 16.5-inches with an all-new design. Further, Kuo says Apple will return to the display market with a 31.6-inch 6k3k monitor. This display is said to feature a [Mini LED-like](https://www.ledinside.com/news/2018/5/difference_between_micro_led_and_mini_led) backlight design, giving it “outstanding picture quality.”

I don't usually write about rumors, but this is juicy. [The partnership with LG](/2017/02/lg-has-redesigned-its-5k-mac-monitor-so-it-can-handle-being-placed-near-a-router-recode/) was rocky at best, so returning to the display business makes a lot of sense in my mind. Apple may be sweating the details less than in previous years, but this partnership made it abundantly clear how bad things could be without them.

As [Matt Birchler points out](https://birchtree.me/blog/holy-apple-rumor-bomb-batman/), the cost of this 6K display will no doubt be high, but its design and functionality will most likely blow everything else on the market out of the water. Not to mention, this isn't something you upgrade often. I had my Thunderbolt Display for about seven years, so at that point, it had paid for itself many times over.

The 16-inch MacBook Pro is an intriguing rumor too. After years of Apple going smaller and thinner for almost everything, why increase the size? Maybe we'll see a MacBook Pro with <span class="caps">I/O</span> and ports added back?

Whether all or some of these rumors turn out to be true, one thing is for sure: 2019 looks to be an exciting year.
