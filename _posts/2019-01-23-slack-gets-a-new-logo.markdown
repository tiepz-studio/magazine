Lots of commotion over this redesign, and to a certain extent, it's completely understandable. While I don't find myself feeling "[repulsed](https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/1086288908655181825)," this new direction certainly feels like a regression. There was a lot of brand equity, thrown away for what ultimately feels generic.
