Ben Brooks:

> The underwear are all synthetic and comfortable to wear. They are moisture wicking, claim to be anti-bacterial, and anti-stink I guess as well. None of this matters to me on a practical level, but I can say: they don’t seem to get stinky, not that I’ve gone in for *the* sniff.

I'm so glad Ben writes about stuff like this. Packing five to seven pairs of underwear is such a waste of space. Can't wait to try these out.
