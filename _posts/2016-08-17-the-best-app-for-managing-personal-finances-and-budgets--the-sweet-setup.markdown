Mike Schmitz for *The Sweet Setup*:

> There are an abundance of options when it comes to budgeting apps for Mac users. Weâ€™ve put many of them through the ringer and believe [Banktivity](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/banktivity-5-formerly-ibank-5/id675813946?mt=12&at=11l7ja&ct=tss) (formerly iBank) has the right blend of powerful features and ease of use that can help just about anyone take control of their finances.

This app looks very interesting. I was in need of an app to help us have a better understanding of where our money is going. This might be it.
