Jan Honza Odvarko:

> Firebug has been a phenomenal success. Over its 12-year lifespan, the open source tool developed a near cult following among web developers. When it came out in 2005, Firebug was the first tool to let programmers inspect, edit, and debug code right in the Firefox browser.

> So it’s sad that Firebug is now reaching end-of-life in the Firefox browser, with the release of Firefox Quantum (version 57) next month. The good news is that all the capabilities of Firebug are now present in current Firefox Developer Tools.

I was a bit late to the Firebug game. If I recall correctly, I started using it in 2007—two years after its release. Still, Firebug is a huge reason I'm a frontend developer today. Every site I'd visit would get inspected. In addition to [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), inspecting sites in Firebug taught me how to build websites.

While it's sad to see the name Firebug retire, Mozilla still does an amazing job with their developer tools in Firefox. And in my opinion, still has the best CSS Grid inspector.
