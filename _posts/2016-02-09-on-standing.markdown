Chris Bowler:

> After these past three years, I can attest to the fact that standing vs. sitting is not the discussion we should be having. It’s inactivity, period. If you’re standing in front of a computer for 8 hours a day, you’re not moving enough. Your heart rate is too slow. While your brain is working away, your body is wasting away.

Being healthy in this profession is very difficult, but not impossible. I'm trying a new thing where I do a brisk activity for ninety seconds every hour.
