> Recently, while editing some CSS in Opera inspector, I noticed a CSS property called writing-mode, this was the first time that I know of it. After some research, I learned that its purpose is for vertical language scripts, like Chinese or Japanese. However, the interesting thing is that when using it with English, we can create a vertical text very easily.
