Jonathan Snook:

> I’ve been fortunate over the past decade to have been able to, in various capacities, work from home—or [work in place](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/jobs/remote-thats-no-way-to-describe-this-work.html), as some like to call it. First as a freelancer, then Yahoo!, then again when I went to work at Xero, and now back to working for myself.

If you lead a remote team or happen to work on one, this post is for you. Jonathan’s thoughts on communication is of special significance. Communication—especially the written form—is **invaluable** when either working remotely or working on a team where some are. You need to document everything; there’s no other way to keep everyone in the loop.

But it all starts with us. It’s our job to help educate our onsite co-workers that documenting is not only helpful to remote employees, but in the end to everyone.
