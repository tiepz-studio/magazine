I've never been on a cruise. I'd always been nervous to do it. [Watching Kurt Russell die in Poseidon](https://youtu.be/5Cv89LY4QkU) freaked the hell out of me. Plus, I sometimes get motion sickness, and thought it'd be a long week if I got sea-sick.

Turns out, I was just fine! This is by far the most fun vacation I've ever taken. We saw all sorts of beautiful landscapes, and water so clear I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

If you've never been on a cruise, I highly recommend it. The experience is really great. There's something to do for all types of personalities.

Now, back to the routine with renewed energy and focus!
