Emily Asher-Perrin for Tor.com:

> *The Last Jedi* was a film designed to cup your heart in its hands and then crush it repeatedly at intermittent intervals. I counted no less than twelve moments that destroyed me.

Emily is right. I felt there were several moments that had me teary-eyed. The scene with R2-D2 and Luke was the best.
