Justin Carter writing for *CBR*:

I'm shocked by this news. When [Netflix announced the cancellation of *Iron Fist*](https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/10/12/17971874/iron-fist-canceled-netflix), that made sense to me. The show didn't do well in its first season, and while the second season was a huge improvement, I'd think some didn't give it a second chance.

My hope is that this isn't the last we've seen of Luke Cage. He's a great character that was perfectly cast.
