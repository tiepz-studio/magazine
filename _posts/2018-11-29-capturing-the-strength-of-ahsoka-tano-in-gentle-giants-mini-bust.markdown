Ahsoka Tano is my favorite character from the animated series. Narratively, her personality and outlook on the Jedi would've fit perfectly in _The Last Jedi_, but who knows if she's still alive in the timeline. Then again, I'm not sure if Togruta age the same as humans.

Either way, this bust is so cool. <mark>Ahsoka deserves to be in a live-action&nbsp;film.</mark>
