I created a style guide for *The Bold Report* and wanted to quickly tell you about it. It's not much, but an explanation of the different elements that exist through out this site. 

Writing all these explanations turned out to be an excellent exercise. It made me stop and think what was useful, and what elements didn't need to exist. I hadn't realized the unspoken patterns that had developed over time.

I like looking at style guides. [Dan Eden's](https://daneden.me/styleguide/) is a good one to look at. He even has a [writing style guide](https://daneden.me/styleguide/writing/). Anyway, if you're into this sort of thing, I invite you to take a look.
