Jessica Goldstein writing for *Vulture*:

> *House of Cards* fired Kevin Spacey, and offed his character, Frank Underwood, amid a multitude of credible allegations of sexual predation, rape, and violence. In the wake of these revelations and Spacey’s removal came a creative opportunity: With Frank axed, the show could go places that did not involve Frank at all. Nothing in this farewell season needed to be about Frank. But virtually everything was.

*Spoiler warning. Don't click through on this unless you're ok with that.*

Jessica nails it with her criticism of this final episode and final season. It was disappointing to see a show that began so incredibly well to end so horribly.
