Adi Robertson writing for *The Verge*:

> Scoble, who apparently published this post against the advice of his lawyer, claims he did not have enough power over his accusers to sexually harass them. “If I were guilty of all the things said about me I would still not be in a position to have sexually harassed anyone,” he writes.
>
> …his latest defense puts forward an absurd definition of sexual harassment and effectively accuses women of reporting it to fit in with the cool crowd, while claiming he’s writing in “a spirit of healing.”

Robert Scoble is not only an idiot, he's scum. This dude thinks it's ok to suggest that peer pressure is what motivated his accusers to come forward. Oh, and lest we forget, that wasn't the worst part. After explaining how his multiple infidelities were "consensual," he goes on to plug his new business. Despicable.
