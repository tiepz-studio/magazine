My goodness. There were so many times in this article that I wondered if *I* was even a front end dev.  It seems that every company has their own requirements of what that job should be, and some are just completely insane. Laurence does a great job of breaking it down to the basics, and then covering where the front end developer should be expanding their knowledge.

Like Laurence, the area I need to improve is Javascript.
