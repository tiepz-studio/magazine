Tara Mann:

> I recently spent a few weeks serial interviewing. I spoke to around 20 companies in the span of about a month and damn it was exhausting. I knew early on that I needed to add structure to my job hunt. Presented here are some of the principles and thought processes that guided my search.

Tara has got some great tips here. I've been using Highrise to track my job search, but I think I'll be moving to a Google spreadsheet too. Whatever it is that you decide to do, the pattern of advice seems to be to stay organized.
