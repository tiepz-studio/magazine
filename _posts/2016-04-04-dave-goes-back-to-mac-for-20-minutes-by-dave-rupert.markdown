Uncle Dave:

> When I opened up my Macbook I hadn’t charged it in weeks or months, but instantly the screen came on and there was still 54% battery. I couldn’t help but contrast this to my Surface which takes an embarassing 30+ seconds to awake from sleep and seems to only have a half day hour battery life even shutdown.

Dave writes about his continuing saga on Windows—it's been pretty bumpy. The story turns out to be a great source of lessons applicable to building the web too.
