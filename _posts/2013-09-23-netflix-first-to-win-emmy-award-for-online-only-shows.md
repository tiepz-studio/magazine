>Netflix made history tonight, winning three Emmy awards for House of Cards, becoming the first company to win the awards for online-only shows. Original shows produced by Netflix had received 14 nominations â€” 9 of those for House of Cards alone.

This is huge. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Netflix gets it. They're making entertaining shows, and minimizing piracy. Traditional television hasn't been able to nail both.
