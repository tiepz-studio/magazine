> Increasingly, companies are demanding cult-like devotion. Do whatever it takes; sacrifice whatever you’ve got. It’s no longer enough to punch in, put in a solid day’s work, and go home. Now, you’re expected to be on Slack 24/7, use your social network to promote the company, recruit friends to the team, go to events in the evening, and use your personal equipment.

> All of this would be fine if employees benefited from their sacrifice in the same way their bosses do. [But they don’t](https://thinkfaster.co/2015/12/beware-of-the-silicon-valley-cult/).
