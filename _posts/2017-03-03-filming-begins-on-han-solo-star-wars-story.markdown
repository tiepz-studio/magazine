Here's another one I missed while [under the weather](/2017/02/under-the-weather/). From StarWars.com:

> Cameras are rolling on the adventure-filled past of the iconic scoundrel and everyone’s favorite Wookiee; principal photography on the untitled Han Solo *Star Wars* Story officially began February 20 at Pinewood Studios, London.
>
> The movie will explore the duo’s adventures before the events of *Star Wars: A New Hope*, including their early encounters with that other card-playing rogue from a galaxy far, far away, Lando Calrissian.

How exciting! I love how all these spin-offs are exploring backstory we'd never known before. Together with the announcement was the first cast photo too.
