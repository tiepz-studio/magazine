Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk is my favorite of the Marvel TV villains (followed closely by David Tenant's Kilgrave, of course) so understandably, I'm excited to see that he'll be a big part of this season. The stakes are high this season, not only is Wilson Fisk a physically powerful enemy, his political influence and control of public perception is what makes him a complex foe to defeat.

Season three of *Daredevil* debuts on Netflix October 19th.
