Katie Floyd on the [LG UltraFine 5K Display](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKN62LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display?fnode=7c):

> I was willing to get over the looks and the cost and accept this was the price I must pay to have the best display available to match my new MacBook Pro. Problem was…I couldn't buy it. Had the LG/Apple display been available for purchase the day I ordered my MacBook Pro I have no doubt I would have gritted my teeth and added it to my cart. But I couldn’t.

This is interesting. While I don't see myself giving up on a 5K display for a 4K display, I do see where Katie is coming from. Katie was ready to hand over some serious cash, but because Apple is more and more unreliable when it comes to deadlines they themselves set, she's now purchased something else. Yes, she's one person, but a reputation is being built and money is being lost. A thousand dollars is a thousand dollars.
