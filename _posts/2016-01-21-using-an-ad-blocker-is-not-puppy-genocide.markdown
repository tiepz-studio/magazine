Timothy Geigner on *Techdirt*:

> Lots of sites have recently made ad blocking software a target of their ire, complaining that such software ruins everything and is a form of puppy genocide or whatever.

Boy do they play the victim. His explanation of why people use ad blockers is on point: 

> There's a reason why users use ad blockers after all: many online ads suck harder than a vacuum cleaner looking for love. But *they don't have to*.

That's what these idiotic, pushing-their-own-selves-into-irrelevance companies don't seem to understand. We get that ads support their business, but *we don't want to be tracked*, and *the ad shouldn't take over the freaking page*.  Serve me an ad, don't track me, load the page fast, and I'll gladly turn off my ad blocker for you.
