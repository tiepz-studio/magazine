Yep, more Star Wars. Here’s Jeremy Keith:

> Those bothered by the echoes between Star Wars and The Force Awakens are going to be really pissed off when they find out about World War One and World War Two. “Britain and America fight Germany again? Really!?” (Probably best not to even mention any of the Gulf wars).
> 
> I get the feeling though that the people who are bothered by the plot are perhaps overplaying the similarities and underplaying the differences.

Jeremy’s piece echoes a lot of my feelings on the film, and his speculations at the end are very interesting.
