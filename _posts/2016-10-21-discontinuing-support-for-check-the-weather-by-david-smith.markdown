David Smith:

> Four years ago today I [introduced](https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/258558679526285313) a weather app called *Check the Weather*. I was really proud of how it turned out. It was my first app where I was able to do everything ‘right’ from the beginning.

This news really bums me out. I'm a huge fan of *Check the Weather*. I purchased it a few years ago, and it's been my one-and-only weather app (even though it didn't have an Apple Watch complication). Seems that I'll be switching to [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/app/).

Thank you for all of your hard work on this app, David. RIP *Check the Weather*.
