This is an important talk to watch. All of us use open-source libraries, and while this talk is ruby-specific, our support and contribution to the communities we belong to is important. Most open-source software is worked on people's free time, and even if they're currently being paid by a company to do so, that's no guarantee it'll continue forever nor does it absolve our responsibility to help.
