Brooks Barnes writing for the *New York Times*:

> 20th Century Fox’s big-budget “Fantastic Four” went down in flames at the weekend box office, adding to fears about superhero fatigue[…]

Superhero fatigue? No. People want a well-made film with a great story.

Everything seems to point to the fact that if Fox would’ve let Josh Trank do the film he wanted, the movie might have been better. Although I’m still not sure it would’ve been good.

But the notion that people didn’t watch this movie because of “superhero fatigue” is utterly stupid. People didn’t watch because they could smell the stink a mile away.
