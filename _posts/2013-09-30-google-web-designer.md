Interestingly, I see a tool like this from Google, and my whole opinion changes. I had some pretty harsh things to say about Macaw.[^1]

Google—in many ways—is the reason I do my job the way I do it. They're advocates for building the web well, and fast. It's hard for me to believe they'll make a tool that does the opposite.

[^1]: I don't know what happened to the tweet. But, I basically said that Macaw holds designers back from doing what they should do: learn to code.
