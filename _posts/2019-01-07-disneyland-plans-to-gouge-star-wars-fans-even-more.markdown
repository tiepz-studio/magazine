Well, this sucks. It feels like a greedy cash grab to further take advantage of us *Star Wars* fans. What's sad is that I can pay this stupid price, but how do they expect families to be able to afford this? Sadly less fortunate fans will miss out on what will likely be an amazingly immersive experience.

Disney says these price hikes are part of their strategy to control crowds, but one would think to limit the number of tickets purchased in a day would do that better than raising the price to astronomical proportions.

I sincerely hope (most likely unrealistically) that Disney reconsiders this strategy. They have a plethora of characters that children and adults alike have come to love; it would be a shame that only the rich would get to experience them.
