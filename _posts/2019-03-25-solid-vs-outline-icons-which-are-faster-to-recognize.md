> Some think the difference between them is just a matter of preference, but research shows there’s more to it than that–one style has a faster recognition rate than the other.

Fascinating. I remember a few years ago an article circulated arguing against outline icons because of cognitive load (can't find the link, sorry), but it turns out the decision is a bit more complex than that.
