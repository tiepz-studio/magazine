Adam Geitgey:

> I’m not here to change your mind about the MacBook Pro. Yes, it’s probably too expensive and more RAM is better than less RAM. But everyone posting complaints without actually *using* a MBP for a few weeks is missing out on all the clever things you can do because it is built on USB-C. Over the past week or two with a new MacBook Pro (15in, 2.9ghz, TouchBar), I’ve been constantly surprised with how USB-C makes new things possible. It’s a kind of a hacker’s dream.

I completely agree with Adam here. The opportunities at our fingertips with USB-C are pretty exciting. I will say: it's ironic that his mobile examples bring out how much more compatible the new MacBook Pro is with Android devices.
