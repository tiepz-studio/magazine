Chris Begley on Batman News:

> By now you know the story: Zack Snyder turned in a cut of Justice League earlier this year but Warner Bros. wasn’t satisfied with it. Joss Whedon was brought in to rewrite the script, and WB CEO Kevin Tsujihara [reportedly mandated that the movie be no longer than two hours](https://batman-news.com/2017/11/06/new-justice-league-details-wb-ceo-demanded-it-be-under-two-hours-plus-more-interesting-info/).
>
> Over the weekend, some of [Zack Snyder’s deleted scenes leaked online](https://batman-news.com/2017/11/18/deleted-justice-league-scene-shows-kiersey-clemons-as-iris-west-in-action-video/), leaving fans wondering how much different his version of the movie was than the one that hit theaters.

[I've said it once](http://thetim.blog/2017/11/21/how-many-times.html), and I'll say it again: How many times does Zack Synder need to put out a bad film for people to understand that his "director cut" doesn't change anything? Don't get me wrong, Zack Snyder's visuals are unparalleled, but a storyteller he is not.

*Justice League* looks beautiful, but the mess of a story is not Joss Whedon's fault nor that of critics. It's just not a great movie, and that's ok. Warner Bros. ambitions however, are obviously much higher than that. If they were smart they'd either trash everything and start over or get Zack away from having any type of opinion on story and world building.

Cinematic universes don't happen overnight, Marvel has been working on their's for the better part of a decade now. DC needs to stop trying to compete with Marvel and instead do *their own thing*.
