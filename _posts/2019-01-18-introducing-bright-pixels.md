**TL;DR** *Brightly Colored* is now called *Tiepz Magazine*.

Welcome to the new *Tiepz Magazine*. It almost feels ridiculous to be writing another post like this only fifteen months after [the last one](/2017/10/a-new-beginning/).

When I chose the name *Brightly Colored*, I was excited. The name seemed to say a lot about me in just two words. But unfortunately, the name wasn't ideal for people trying to find the site via search engine. Most search engines assume people are trying to get the definition of "brightly colored"—not a blog about geekery. 

I wouldn't have known any of this without the help of [John Locke](https://twitter.com/Lockedown_).  John ran an audit of  *Brightly Colored* and helped me realize I needed a new name (among other things) to do better with search engines.

Now don't get me wrong, the purpose of this site isn't to make a living, so search engine optimization isn't the number one priority. However, I've been writing this web-column since 2013. There are many articles I poured a lot of time into and that have value. It'd be a shame for people not to be able to find that information quickly.

So here we are, with a new name… again. I hope you like it. As always, thank you for reading.
