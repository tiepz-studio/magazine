> The most painful part of Black Label has been DC’s backpedalling. They promised a mature comic book line and then went back on their word at the first sign of trouble: a silhouette of Batman’s junk.

Agreed. [Here's what I said back in September of last year](/2018/09/dc-comics-wont-reprint-batman-damned-number-1/):

> This all feels like an overreaction, really. It was clear the title is for adults so… I guess I don’t see what the big deal is.

I continue to feel the same. DC had to know that people would be shocked (likely because it's Batman, and because people seem to be more scandalized by male nudity). Instead of riding the wave and letting the shock pass by, they allowed the ordeal to cower them. Personally, it confirms that if you want risky and adult-geared stories, the big two are probably not the place to find them.
