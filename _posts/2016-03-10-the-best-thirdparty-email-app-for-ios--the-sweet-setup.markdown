As shocked as I was to read Outlook being touted as the best third-party email app for iOS, I was even more shocked to agree. That’s right, *I agree*.

Outlook is a beautifully designed app. Its integration with my calendar is seamless which is greatly important to me. I’m asked to be in meetings a few times a week, and Outlook is currently the best experience to glance at availability and easily RSVP.

I don’t make a habit of recommending Microsoft products, but when something is this good, I just can’t help it. I recommend Outlook for iOS, and obviously I recommend you read the full review.
