> I’m going to give my dad the last word, by reading from the end of his will, a message that he addressed directly to all of you — the people who meant so much to him in his life. Here’s what he wrote:
>
>> Well, I think that’s about it for now. If I think of anything else, I’ll let you know. (Ha Ha.)
>>
>> I’ll sure miss you a lot, more than you’ll ever know.
>>
>> Maybe I’ll see you where ever God decides to send me. I hope there’ll be fishing and pretty girls, good music, my Mom’s Italian spaghetti, and beer.
>>
>> Thank you all for everything, your love, your friendship, good fun, good laughs and memories, and for the pleasure just to know each and every one of you.
>>
>> With all my love, now and forever.
>>
>> Bye for now,
>>
>> Me  
>> Stephen

What a beautiful eulogy. I'm so sorry for your loss Andy.
