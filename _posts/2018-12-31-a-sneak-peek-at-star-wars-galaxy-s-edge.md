File this one under "reason's why I don't mind Disney owning Lucasfilm." It feels like they've been working on this for a while, but maybe that's my impression because [David Sparks is always hyping it up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MacSparky/status/1075504380995022848).

Kelly and I were at Disney World in Orlando back in August, and I was pretty disappointed with most of the attractions. A lot of them are outdated, and anything you want to buy is ridiculously overpriced. "Happiest place on earth" my ass.

With that sour experience in mind, I'm cautiously optimistic of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. Disney is really pushing immersive Star Wars experiences with attractions like this, and [a hotel](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/07/plans-unveiled-for-star-wars-inspired-themed-resort-at-walt-disney-world/) (which looks *amazing*). I just hope it's not gimmicky, expensive garbage.
