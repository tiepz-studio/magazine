One of my favorite developers, [Flexibits](https://flexibits.com/), has released their newest app called Cardhop. Cardhop was already [on the Mac](https://flexibits.com/cardhop) and I love it.

Managing contacts is one of those things that just kind of sucks. Cardhop makes it easy to view contacts, edit them, and even share your own info. What's the point of a business card, when you can just show someone a QR code that they can scan with their phone? Save the trees and use this instead.

Cardhop for iOS [is on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cardhop/id1448744070?mt=8&at=1010lJWg
&ct=bpx) for a steal at $3.99.
