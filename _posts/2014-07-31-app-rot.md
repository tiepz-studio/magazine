Marco Arment:

> The app market is becoming a mature, developed industry, with vastly increased commoditization compared to its early days. Competition is ubiquitous, relentless, and often shameless, even in categories that were previously under-the-radar niches. Standing out requires more effort than ever, yet profits are harder to come by than ever.

> Full-time iOS indie developers — people who make the majority of their income from sales of their apps, rather than consulting or other related work — are increasingly rare.

The struggle of the indie developer is real. It all points to the burst of a bubble we've been enjoying the past few of years. I for one, hope those of us who work hard to create quality work can survive the impact.
