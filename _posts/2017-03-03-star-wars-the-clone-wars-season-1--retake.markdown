> Familiar but animated characters everywhere — some liked, some not. The Clone Wars series brings us the great Obi-wan Kenobi, the mediocre Anakin Skywalker, and the terrible, awful, Jar Jar Binks — the worst thing to come from George Lucas mind. On this episode of Retake, Tim and TJ will analyze the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

You know how much I love to talk about Star Wars. This time, TJ Draper and I sit down to talk about *The Clone Wars*, a excellent TV series from 2008 you should definitely watch.
