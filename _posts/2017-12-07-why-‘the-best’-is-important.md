Ben Brooks on _The Brooks Review_:

> I search for, and try to buy, the best of each item I use extensively because I don’t like to be annoyed by the things I use often. This is the deciding factor for me, but not all the factors. It’s a bit of a balancing act, deciding if and when to expand the budget on something to get an item which is better. Often, I’ll forgo buying something I want or need, and wait until I can buy the best of that item.

> There’s one thing none of us can get back, and that’s time, as cliché as that is. Time is not recoverable, and the time spent being annoyed by something is doubly wasteful as you both lose time _and_ happiness.

Ben makes a great case here. I find myself feeling similarly. I'd rather wait, save up money, and buy the best thing than buy the cheap thing because it's cheap. I actually have a perfect example for this.

Kelly and I have been wanting to get a new mattress and adjustable bed base. I've done lots of research and found the best one for us. This thing is over a $1000 and the matress is pretty pricey too. Amazon has an adjustable base for a little over $400, but it doesn't have the features that my research has led me to know we'll need. Will it take us a few months to save to buy the mattress and bed base we want? Sure, but we'll only have to spend money _once_, bring this stuff in _once_, and set everything up _once_. I think that's worth it.
