Itâ€™s Wednesday again! Hereâ€™s what I read last week, and what Iâ€™m picking up this week. Also! New category: what Iâ€™m dropping ðŸ˜±

## What I picked up last week

- **Batgirl: Stephanie Brown Vol. 1**  
Loved this book! I really enjoyed seeing Barbara deal with her circumstances, and how that moves her to be of help to others. Stephanie is a great character, and earns wearing the suit.
- **Deadpool & Cable Annual**  
This was hilarious. While some of the time jumping was a bit confusing, Deadpoolâ€™s monologue on the difference between comics and films was spectacular.
- **Teen Titans #20**  
Wanted to give this a try because the book is starting a new arc with new team members. Iâ€™ll pick up the next few issues possibly, but Iâ€™m not 100 percent convinced just yet. I expected a little more humor in this book.

## Picking up this week

- **Teen Titans #21**
- **X-men Red #7**  
The last issue came out so long ago, I think I need a refresh of what happened. Still, I love Tom Taylor and the way he writes. Overall, Iâ€™m enjoying the arc and cast of characters.
Amazing Spider-man #4 - Iâ€™m shocked issue four is already here! I feel like I just read number three! Loving this run. Nick Spencer writes Spider-man true to what I feel the character is, and Iâ€™m excited to see what Peter Parker will do in his current predicament.
- **Mr. and Mrs. X #2**  
Kelly Thompson did a great job with the first issue of this comic (and I say that without knowing much about Rogue and Gambit). Deadpool is in this issue, so weâ€™ll see what she does with him.
- **West Coast Avengers #1**  
Another Kelly Thompson book. I donâ€™t know anything about the West Coast Avengers, but itâ€™s a new book, and Kellyâ€™s writing it.

## Dropping this week

Whoa! New section!

- **Black Panther #3**  
Dropping this book after two issues. I feel confused with whatâ€™s going on, and the tone is darker than what I wanted in this title.
