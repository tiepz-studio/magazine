This is a fascinating post. We're all used to seeing the conventional "I'm starting a new job" post, but this one is unique in that I've never seen a job visualized like this. One thing becomes very clear after reading this: looking for a job is awful and time-intensive.

Still, I would love to see more posts like this. It's very educational. The idea of using a spreadsheet to keep track of everything is helpful, although I'd assume you could use something like [Highrise](https://highrisehq.com/) too. My big takeaway: organization is key if you want your job search to be successful in less time.
