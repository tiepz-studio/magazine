Official episode description from NightOwl.fm:

> Asgard is in "Hela" big trouble, but Thor and Hulk are here to save the day, of course. Join Tim and TJ on this comedic thrill ride!

TJ and I are on a roll releasing two episodes these past two weeks! Wellâ€¦ we kind of cheated and recorded two back-to-back. Either way, I really enjoyed talking about *Thor: Ragnarok*. Not only is the name fun to say, this film was an exciting watch. This movie was filled with a great score, wonderful acting, and excellent character development for Thor and Hulk, making it the best Thor movie yet.
