Dear Reader,

As you may have noticed, I haven't been writing on this site for a while. The reason is that I've started a new thing and while I get used to the schedule, I haven't had the time to write much.

The new thing is [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IRnf7JYYUkWqPO8wx_QNQ). I'd been thinking of doing video for a while, but was shy to be in front of the camera. Slowly, I'm getting more comfortable with it and talking as if I'm talking to the viewer.

What's funny about all of this to me, is that I thought I'd learned how to do this for audio. I'd been told that I had a very natural radio voice and I mostly agreed. But video is a whole new beast.

This new YouTube channel will feature a lot of the same content I've written on here for the past three years. New technology I'm interested in, some Apple news, movie reviews, and the personal update every once in a while.

My hope is as I get my footing in video, the video content and written content complement each other. This way, if you enjoy one over the other, you'll get your fix. For now, I'll be focusing more on video and growing that. I really hope you come along for the ride.

In the new few weeks, I've got some interesting videos planned. Here a few:

1. **Photive PH-BTH3 Wireless Headphones Review**  
I bought [these headphones on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2tXHv2G) for $40. I really wanted to find some cheap headphones for my Dad. I wanted to test them out to see if he'd like them. This Thursday, I'll post my video review of them.

2. **Spider-Man Homecoming Review**   
This movie comes out July 7<sup>th</sup>. Tobey Maguire was my favorite Spider-Man[^man] so I was skeptical to see how Tom Holland would do. His performance was excellent in Civil War, so I'm excited to see this film.

3. **Scooter/Gear Overview**   
If you didn't know, [I recently got a scooter](https://www.instagram.com/p/BULROQXjb1p/?taken-by=smithtimmytim). I'm hooked. I love being on two wheels. Can't wait to upgrade to a bigger bike. In the meantime, I'm planning a video on what I got.

Hope that get's you excited enough [to subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1IRnf7JYYUkWqPO8wx_QNQ). I need 100 subscribers or more to claim a custom username on YouTube so your help to get there is much appreciated!

Before I let you go, here's my latest video on the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock. If you have a new MacBook Pro, I recommend you watch it.

Thank you so much for reading. See you on YouTube.

[^man]: Don't you dare judge me!!
