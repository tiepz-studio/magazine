From BBC News:

> Walt Disney has agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business for $52.4bn (£39bn), in a deal both companies said position them to compete in the rapidly changing media industry.
>
> The purchase includes Fox's film and television studios, as well as its 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky.
>
> Fox will form a news-focused company with its remaining assets.

Exciting times! Marvel Studios now has access to all of their characters and Lucasfilm regains the distribution rights of the original trilogy. [I wrote on what a buyout like this could mean](/2017/11/21st-century-fox-has-been-holding-talks-to-sell-most-of-the-company-to-disney-sources-cnbc/) a few weeks ago, but it's now a reality. Obviously the deal is subject to the government giving the ok, but I'm sure there's some type of fallback agreement in place.

Here's what I'm looking forward to:

- Rereleases of the original *Star Wars* trilogy without all the special edition crap.
- Hugh Jackman coming back as Wolverine. Enough said.
- A great X-Men film. I hope they move away from Jennifer Lawrence playing Mystique. She's a great actress, but she doesn't seem all that excited about this franchise nor should her character be that important. I want McAvoy to stay.
- A great Fantastic Four film. In the comics, the Fantastic Four are amazing and play a big role in a lot of storylines. They deserve to be done right. I like [Charlie Schneider's idea](https://youtu.be/lirOiVGD62g) to not actually give them a whole film to start, but more of a Tony-Stark-in-Spider-Man role.

Geeks everywhere, rejoice!
