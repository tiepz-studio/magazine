> Today Flexibits [released version 2.2](http://flexibits.com/blog/2016/03/fantastical-2-2-for-mac-aka-the-massively-big-massively-awesome-update/) of Fantastical for the Mac. They could've easily named this update version 3.0. There are a lot of new features in this updateâ€¦

If you are on the fence about buying Fantastical, David's excellent video should eliminate your hesitance. The update is only further proof that buying this app is a great investment.
