Rachel Andrew on the effect of no longer having a personal site:

> As we move our code to CodePen, our writing to Medium, our photographs to Instagram we donâ€™t *just* run the risk of losing that content and the associated metadata if those services vanish. We also lose our own place to experiment and add personality to that content, in the context of our own home on the web.

There seem to be more and more people returning to their personal sites. I'm glad. Rachel makes such an excellent point too. Not only will you regain the ownership of your content, but you have a home to experiment with.

Long live the personal site!
