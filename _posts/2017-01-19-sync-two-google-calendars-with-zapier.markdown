So here's the problem: you've got a personal calendar and a work calendar, but you want both to be in sync. Googling how to do this is practically useless. Mostly, you'll find articles or support posts on how you should share the calendars with each other, which doesn't accomplish what I wanted. I wanted all events synced on both calendars so:

1. I didn't have to manually duplicate events to the other calendar.
2. People checking my work or personal calendar had an accurate representation of my availability.

Finally I came across this video, and turns out that what I wanted to do was merge two calendars. I'm now in calendar bliss. When I create an event in my personal calendar, that event is created in my work calendar and vice versa. The great thing is, because this works with Zapier, you have more options that just Google calendar if you need them.
