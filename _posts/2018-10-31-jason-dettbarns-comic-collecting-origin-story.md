Jason Dettbarn writing on *Relic Scout*:

> So this is the story where I admit I became a comic book geek at 36 years old. 36 YEARS OLD. You read that right.

> Holding the books in my hand, reading them cover to cover, and making those weekly trips became a ritual. One that became calming AND frantic all at the same time. On one hand, I got engrossed in the escapism of the stories. Living the fantasy of the characters lives, relationships, and choices in my mind. On the other hand, I NEEDED to read the next issue. Like now. I couldn’t wait until next month. So, what does one in that situation naturally do? Add more to my pull list, of course!

Jason describes a lot of what I feel about comics. He's inspired me to pen my own comic collecting origin story that I'll publish in the next few weeks. If you've never given comics a shot because you feel they're just for kids or only about superheroes, Jason gives some great recommendations at the end of his post.
