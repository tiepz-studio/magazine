Dan Moren on *Six Colors*:

> Movies Anywhere promises a pretty sizable library, though there are still holdouts—Paramount being the largest, along with other significant players like Lionsgate. But the service is sweetening the pot by offering users a handful of free movies when you link an account.

> Dare I say, this seems like an indication that Hollywood is finally “getting it” where digital film purchases are concerned.

I love seeing stuff like this. I buy most of my movies on iTunes, but a service like this is the pathway to being platform-agnostic which I *always* think is a better bet. I love the movie experience Apple has created, but being able to buy in other places, then watching wherever I want is the way I want technology to work.

I'm really happy to see movie studios buy into this idea. I sincerely believe people want to buy movies, however when studios restrict where or how they view them, people are pushed into piracy.

I hope more studios jump onto this bandwagon.
