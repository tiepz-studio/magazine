A few weeks ago, [David Sparks wrote about a new mechanical keyboard](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2019/1/getting-back-on-the-mechanical-keyboard-train) he was buying. I'd stumbled upon the video a few days before, but after seeing him write about it, I pulled the trigger on [the 104-key, Space Grey for Mac version](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-mechanical-keyboard?variant=17299001933913).

My package was delayed a day due to some bad weather here in Saint Paul, so I was able to get my hands on it yesterday finally. I opened up the minimal packaging and used it for the day. The keyboard is shockingly slim, and while it doesn't have flip out feet, the angle was perfectly comfortable for me.

Unfortunately it doesn't come charged, but it's <span class="caps">USB-C</span> connectivity made that an easy fix. It's only been a day, so I can't even begin to give you any type of review. So far, the pairing and using of the Keychron K1 has been smooth.

[You can buy your own](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-mechanical-keyboard?variant=17299001933913), starting at just $74.
