Jim Trotter and Eric D. Williams reporting for *ESPN*:

> [Chargers](http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sd/san-diego-chargers) chairman Dean Spanos was in no mood to reflect Thursday morning after officially announcing his plans to move the franchise to Los Angeles after 56 seasons as San Diego's pro football team.

Good riddance, Dean Spanos.
