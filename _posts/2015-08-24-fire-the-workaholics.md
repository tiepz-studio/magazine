David Heinemeier Hansson:

> People who always work late makes the people who don’t feel inadequate for merely working reasonable hours. That’ll lead to guilt, misery, and poor morale. Worse, it’ll lead to ass-in-seat mentality where people will “stay late” out of obligation, but not really be productive.

David wrote this in 2008, and it’s just as true today as it was then. I enjoy having a life, and I've loved working for those who encourage me to live it.
