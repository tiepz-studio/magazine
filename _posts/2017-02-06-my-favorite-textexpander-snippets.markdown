  shortcuts

One of the reasons I love technology is tinkering with it to make my life easier. I'm constantly automating tasks so I can either do them faster, or not have to worry about them at all. I felt writing a series on automation would be a lot of fun, not only because I *love* to geek out about stuff like this, but it might also be helpful to you.

For our first exploration into automation, we'll start with [TextExpander][6508-0001]. For those of you who don't know, TextExpander is an app that expands custom keyboard shortcuts into text or images. For example, you could type `;home`, and it would expand into your full home address. A simple example, but I'm sure you can see how helpful it would be over time.

What's greater, I can use TextExpander anywhere: on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Heck, TextExpander is on Windows too. With that in mind, I'd love to share some of my favorite TextExpander snippets.

## Day One

[Day One][6508-0002] is an excellent journaling app. I love to keep a daily journal, as well as movie and restaurant reviews. In fact, together with [IFTTT][6508-0003] I automatically import Swarm check-ins and Instagram Photos, but that's for another article.

By typing `;foodreview`, I get a form that asks me if I'd go back, how pricey the restaurant was, who I went with, what I ordered, and a general summary.

  <figcaption>Ever go back to a restaurant you really liked, but don't remember what you ordered? No longer!</figcaption>

My movie review snippet is similar. By typing `;moviereview`, I easily log movies I've watched. Some of those movies end up getting their own brief review here on *The Bold Report*, but for those that don't, my thoughts are recorded somewhere. [This one was originally made by David Sparks](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2013/9/textexpander-snippets-media-review), but I modified it and formatted a few things in Markdown.

My last Day One snippet is an end of the day summary. I downloaded this snippet from [Chuck Grimmett](http://cagrimmett.com/2015/12/02/five-minute-journal-textexpander.html) and modified them for my use. I only do this once a day in the evening and it helps me remember key things that happened that day. A little reflection each day feels healthy to me, and reminds me there is so much to be grateful for.

## Jekyll

For all the work that I do with [Jekyll][6508-0004], you might be shocked to hear that I only have one snippet in this category. I probably need more, but I haven't figured them out yet. The one I do have though, is `;jdate`. This simple snippet expands into the date format needed in Jekyll posts, which looks like this:

```yaml
# YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE (using the 24 hour clock)
date: 2017-02-03 12:39
```

This one snippet has saved me hours in the now 3 years I've been using it! I don't have to remember the format, think about what the date is, or remember how you write four o'clock in the 24 hour clock.

## Special Characters

TextExpander publishes [Public Groups](https://textexpander.com/publicgroups) which you can subscribe to, and one of them is Accented Words. For example, I can type `cafe'` and it'll expand into caf√©. I write Spanish occasionally, so I've added some common used words with accents so I don't have to worry about them.

Another use for this group is making it easier to type out modifier key symbols. Let's say you wanted to write out ‚åò‚áßW. It's a pain to remember how to type those characters, and I found myself having to Google search, then copy pasting them over and over. With TextExpander, I've matched each character with its own shortcut. `;command`, `;shift`, `;option`, and `;control`, all expand to the ‚åò, ‚áß, ‚å•, and ‚åÉ symbols.

## Code

When it comes to writing code, autocompletion has come a long way. I had to whiteboard a week ago, and realized I'm useless without my code editor. [Atom][6508-0005] autocompletes everything for me. [Emmet][6508-0006] is a huge help too. *However*, the one coding snippet I use is to create a comment block in SCSS. By typing `;bcomm`, it expands into this:

```scss
// -------------------------------
// SECTION NAME HERE
// -------------------------------
```

It helps me keep my comment style consistent, and saves me time.

## General

My general snippets group is usually where I put snippets that don't belong in any of my other groups. Like `:shrug:` which expands into `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`. For some reason, I seem to use this one a lot. Mostly to answer questions like "What should we do for dinner?" It drives Kelly nuts.

I also have one for üññüèº (probably my most used emoji), which is just `:spock:`. Snippets for my email address and phone number are extremely useful too. You'd be shocked by how much you have to type those last two.

## Conclusion

These are just *some* of my uses for TextExpander. The possibilities are endless, and I hope you see the ways you'd use it.
