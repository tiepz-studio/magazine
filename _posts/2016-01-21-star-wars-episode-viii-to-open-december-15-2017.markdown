From StarWars.com:

> Today, Disney and Lucasfilm announced that Star Wars: Episode VIII, originally scheduled for release in summer 2017, will now debut on December 15, 2017. 

This really bums me out, but I can't say I blame them. The release of Episode VII I think shocked them. The timing was right, and the competition with other summer blockbusters was non-existent. This will give more time to make a quality film, and I can't believe that business and creative interests will actually align.

Yep, we'll have to wait seven more months, but the wait will be worth it.
