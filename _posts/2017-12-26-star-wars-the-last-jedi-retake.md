Official episode description:

> Episode 28: RETAKE reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic of Podcasting, Supreme Leader TJ now deploys his merciless reviewers, Tim Smith and Lisa Cooper to seize control of the Star Wars Conversation.

I've been doing some writing about *The Last Jedi* if you couldn't tell. Of course we needed to record an episode of *Retake* about it too.
