subtitle: What I've been working on lately

For the past month or so, I've been working as a designer and frontend developer for [Mealthy](https://www.mealthy.com/). Mealthy is a startup company whose mission is make cooking healthier food easy. The site has tons of awesome and healthy recipes. 

Soon, we'll be launching the Mealthy SpiraSlicerÂ® which is a 5-blade spiralizer that I'm sure you'll want to check out when it goes on sale. In the meantime, you can [look at some great recipes you'll be able to make with it](https://www.mealthy.com/spiralizer).

Now some fun facts from my first month:

- I've closed 32 pull requests and was involved in some way in 85.
- I have 77 commits to the repo and added more than 9000 lines of code.

I tried to figure out how many of the pull requests involved changes to SCSS, but could figure out how to do that. 

I'm really proud of the work we've accomplished in just a month. I think the site looks great, and was eagerly waiting to show it off. A huge thank you to whole team at Mealthy who've been so welcoming to me and helped make this launch an awesome one.
