Dear Reader,

Just wanted to let you know that I'll be leaving tomorrow to my winter vacation. Eighteen of my family members will be descending upon Miami for us to go on a cruise of the western Carribean.

While I'm gone, [TJ Draper](/authors/tjdraper) will serve as guest editor. He's written a few pieces on this site, [his most recent on building a Hackintosh](/2017/12/building-a-hackintosh/). I leave you in capable hands.

See you January 16<sup>th</sup>.
