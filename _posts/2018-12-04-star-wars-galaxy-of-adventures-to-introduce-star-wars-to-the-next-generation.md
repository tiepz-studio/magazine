[From *Coffee with Kenobi*](https://www.coffeewithkenobi.com/star-wars-galaxy-of-adventures-to-debut-on-all-new-star-wars-kids-website-and-youtube-channel/):

> Adventure awaits you and the younglings in your life in Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures, a new series of animated shorts that will introduce the classic themes, pivotal moments and iconic characters from the Star Wars saga to the next generation.

Smart idea. One of my friends (love you Abi) feels the initial six films are hard enough to keep up with, which is only exacerbated with all the new movies.

Star Wars has a lot of characters, and it can be difficult for new fans to understand where in the timeline some of the movies or series take place. <mark>So as much as this is being touted for kids, it'd most likely help a person of any age to understand the Star Wars&nbsp;universe.</mark>

Watch the trailer below, and [check out Star Wars Kids channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDe7m0POuwkL1gwnQ-FVhMw) for more videos.
