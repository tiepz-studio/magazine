[John Gruber on the iPad Pro](https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros):

> Apple bragged during the iPad Pro introduction that they are faster than 92 percent of notebook PCs sold in the last year. That’s not so funny when you consider that “PCs”, in this formulation, includes MacBooks. iPads were popular and useful when they were much slower than typical notebooks. Now they’re faster than all but the highest-end notebook PCs.

To be honest, I don't know how to feel about this. I'm not 100 percent sure if my iPad Pro is faster than my new MacBook Pro, but I'd rather not know. There's always talk that Apple may move to making its own chips for the Mac, and information like this makes that possible reality all that more appealing.

The iPad is a great device, and an essential one for me. However, [as Ben Brooks points out](https://brooksreview.net/2018/11/serious-ipads/), the iPad seems geared toward a niche group of professionals. With the addition of USB-C, it's never been easier to import photos from my fancy camera. In fact, I could see a photographer not needing any other device in their workflow. <mark>However, front-end development or audio editing are still not easy things to do on the iPad, and the lack of access to the file system is a non-starter for many.</mark>

At the end of the day, this crazy performance is great and all, but I don't think it's a "pro" device just yet.
