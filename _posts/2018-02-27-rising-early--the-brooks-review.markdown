Ben Brooks on *The Brooks Review*:

> I really love ‘life hacking’ articles, specifically how they are based on sample sizes of one, often from people who have literally never tried anything else. (e.g. “I was born a vegan and that’s why I am amazing”, “Rich parents and how you can to”) And one of my favorite tropes is ‘rise early’. Why should you rise early? Because that person did it, started months ago actually, and shit has never been better?

I agree with Ben. This whole idea is pretty laughable. But humans love to give advice and their opinion. As my Dad says, opinions are like anuses, *everyone's got one*.

If waking up at 5am works for you, great! I'm so happy for you. It doesn't work for me. If I wake up earlier than 8:30am, I'm pretty useless. More importantly, I'm crabby. No one wants a crabby Tim.

As ends up being the case in a lot of situations, it comes down to what works for you. Honestly, I think the rising early idea becomes an excuse. It becomes the crutch that people use to excuse why they're not putting out the work they want to, creating the successful business they want to, etc.

The great news is that you can do amazing things at whatever time of the day. Every single person on the planet has twenty-four hours, it's how you use them that matters.
