> Whether it's hiring a product manager, a sales rep, or an engineer, employers often neglect to think about the experience from the interviewee's perspective. They're so worried about finding the most impressive candidate that they don't bother exposing them to the day-to-day work or telling them about the inner workings of the company. As a result, the candidates who interviewed well are asked to take the job with no clue about what they're getting into.

As you may have noticed, [hiring processes are on my mind](/2016/08/on-design-tests/) a lot these days. ReadMe.io is doing something right here, and I'm sure will result in them hiring some really great people.
