> Someone wrote in asking how they might get the "original image" when all they had was the data URL version of the image. I'm not exactly sure how you get into that situation, but hey, I woke up in a trunk more than once.

This is why Chris Coyier is Chris Coyier. He writes about the stuff you've encountered so many times, but think everyone else knows how to do.

I had a very "duh" moment with this one that's sure to get me out of a bind at some point.
