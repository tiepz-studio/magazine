Jeremy Keith:

> [At AMP Conf](https://adactio.com/journal/12011), the Google Search team were at pains to repeat over and over that AMP pages wouldn’t get any preferential treatment in search results …but they appear in a carousel above the search results. Now, if you were to ask any right-thinking person whether they think having their page appear *right at the top* of a list of search results would be considered preferential treatment, I think they would say hell, yes! This is the only reason why The Guardian, for instance, even have AMP versions of their content—it’s not for the performance benefits (their non-AMP pages are faster); it’s for that prime real estate in the carousel.

Jeremy's thoughts on AMP are pretty spot on for the best part. While I agree with his update—“well-meaning people work on even the fishiest of projects”—the way AMP is being pushed and then displayed in Google search is disingenuous.

At this moment, I wouldn't use AMP in my projects.
