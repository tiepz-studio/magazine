[Romana Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reporting for ESPN:](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25684980/jimmy-butler-challenging-philadelphia-76ers-coach-brett-brown-offensive-role)

> Philadelphia 76ers All-Star Jimmy Butler has aggressively challenged coach Brett Brown on his role in the offense, complicating an already tenuous chemistry among the team's Big Three hierarchy, league sources told ESPN.
>
> Butler has been vocal in his contesting of Brown and his system, including a recent film session in Portland that some witnesses considered "disrespectful" and beyond normal player-coach discourse.

I hate to say it, but Jimmy Butler may be the next Dwight Howard: a talented player whose very presence causes the implosion of otherwise good teams. Yes, Butler has a lot more skill than Dwight ever had, but it's a very similar attitude. A "my way or the highway" type of personality that doesn't work well with others.

In the NBA, that's all good and fine when you're winning or when you've established a winning reputation, but Jimmy has neither. Right now, he's nothing more than a child with just a smidge better than average talent who starts drama everywhere he goes.

Somehow I still like him, even with all the problems he caused in Minnesota. Jimmy strikes me as one of those guys that would be a lot more fun to be around if their definition of masculinity were adjusted. I hope someone who truly cares about him can help with that.
