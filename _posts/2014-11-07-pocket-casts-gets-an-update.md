Shifty Jelly updated Pocket Casts to version 5 today, and with that, two of our awesome shows on Goodstuff were featured in the post.

[Here’s what Chris had to say](http://www.chrisenns.com/2014/11/my-favourite-ios-podcast-app-gets-an-update/):

> Maybe some­day I’ll become blasé about see­ing my pod­cast show art pop up around the web, but that day is not today.

Thanks Shifty Jelly. Awesome update.
