I like that Shawn talks about human sustainability because <mark>humans are the core of any financially sustainable&nbsp;business.</mark> But this is also a great life lesson. Your actions need to be in line with the goals you have in life, and sure that’s something must of us would be like “duh” about, but living life in autopilot is all too easy.
