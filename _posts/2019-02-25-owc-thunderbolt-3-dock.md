A Thunderbolt 3 dock is a necessity if you have a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air. If I'm honest, when this initially became a reality, I resented it. But after seeing the flexibility and versatility that a dock like [the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://amzn.to/2Eg9mlA) can afford you, I've never been more in love with <span class="caps">USB-C</span> and Thunderbolt 3.

Since [OWC's first iteration of this dock](https://youtu.be/-bn9r6ykY0Y), there have been a few changes. The back of the device has four <span class="caps">USB-A</span> 3.1 Gen 1 ports, an <span class="caps">S/PDIF</span> digital audio out port, Gigabit Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort 1.2, and two Thunderbolt 3 ports, one of which is now capable of delivering up to 85W; a significant change since the first version which could only deliver up to 60W.

In my testing, even 60W was just fine for keeping my laptop charged, but I spend most of my day at my desk either sitting or standing and connected to the dock. So while 85W is a welcome change, I didn't notice much of a difference.

The Firewire 800 port was dropped, which a year ago would've been more significant to me because of my then audio interface. Since then I've upgraded to an audio interface that conveniently plugs in through Thunderbolt 3.

Regrettably, the vacant space goes unused. We didn't get anymore Thunderbolt 3 ports or even anymore <span class="caps">USB-A</span> ports which is unfortunate. I'm unsure of the technical constraints of making this possible, but if you have a Thunderbolt 3 display (like the LG UltraFine 5K), you'll need to connect any other Thunderbolt 3 devices directly to your Mac, which is no longer a convenient one-cable solution.

I assume this is a problem dock makers haven't quite figured out yet, because <mark markdown="span">none of the competing docks seem to offer more than two Thunderbolt 3&nbsp;ports</mark>.

The front of the device has been upgraded with a microSD slot and a <span class="caps">USB-C</span> 3.1 Gen 2 port. Just like the previous iteration, the front also has a <span class="caps">USB-A</span> 3.1 Gen 1 port, a 35mm headphone jack, and an SD Card reader which unfortunately doesn't seem upgraded with UHS-II support.

Just like before, you can choose between Silver and Space Gray. I received the Space Gray version, which I would've preferred anyway. Its color nicely matches my MacBook but unfortunately still has a shiny plastic top which easily attracts fingerprints and dust. I hope that they'll move to matte plastic in the future.

Overall I think [the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://amzn.to/2Eg9mlA) is still one of the best docks I've seen out there. <mark markdown="span">No product is perfect, but it has a wide range of ports, a competitive price, an attractive design, and *it just&nbsp;works*.</mark>
