[Team Stan in an open letter on Stan Lee’s official website](http://therealstanlee.com/open-letter-to-bill-maher.html):

> Countless people can attest to how <mark>Stan inspired them to read, taught them that the world is not made up of absolutes, that heroes can have flaws and even villains can show humanity within their souls.</mark> He gave us the X-Men, Black Panther, Spider-Man and many other heroes and stories that offered hope to those who felt different and bullied while inspiring countless to be creative and dream of great things to come.

What a classy response to such [tasteless and ignorant remarks from Bill Maher](https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/11/17/bill-maher-comics-industry-reactions/). Unfortunately, there are many who consider comics childish and stupid, as if we love them because we’re too lazy to read a “real” book. 

However, those who choose to find out for themselves learn that comics—just like other story-telling mediums—explore profound themes, comment on important issues, and teach valuable lessons. As I’ve said before, [comics are much more than just super-powered people](/2018/11/my-geek-life/) flying around in capes.
