I love this. Architecture is an integral part of the beauty and history of our cities. The fact that companies like Amazon, and [Apple](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/17/apple-cfo-peter-oppenheimer-speaks-about-apple-campus-2-at-cupertino-press-conference/) are doing things to contribute to that history, in the cities they call home, is a very good thing.
