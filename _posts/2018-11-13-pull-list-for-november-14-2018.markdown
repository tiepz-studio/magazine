## What I read last week

- **Dead Rabbit #2**- I know, I know. [There wasn't much good coming from me](/2018/10/dead-rabbit-number-1-review-aipt/) about this book's first issue. But, it's unfair to judge a book completely on one issue, and I was intrigued by the story. Unfortunately, I again wasn't very impressed after this second issue. However, the covers continue to be stellar.
- **Deadpool #6** - Ever wonder what Deadpool would be like if he was depressed? Wonder no longer! Lots of cameos in this one, but wasn't really feeling it.
- **The Green Lantern #1** - Ok, so what the hell just happened? I have no idea what is going on in this issue, which is strange for a #1. All the hype around this book twisted my arm into picking this up, but I don't think I'll be continuing.
- **X-Men: Red #10** - The conflict with Cassandra Nova has been slow-burning. By the end, this one story arc will have taken eleven issues to tell. Still, I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It'll be exciting to see how the book ends in the next issue, but safe to say Tom Taylor did an excellent job with the series. <mark>No matter how it ends, the battle against Cassandra Nova hasn't felt easy.</mark> She's been a formiddable villain, often a few steps ahead of the X-Men.

**Favorite of the week:** X-Men: Red #10

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #9** - Last issue ended on a pretty awesome cliffhanger. Everyone's stuff has been jacked, and Spidey's in mid-air without his web shooters.
- **Catwoman #5** - Holy moly. [That Artgerm variant](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/4860616/catwoman-5?variant=3285525). Really hoping my LCS has one for me. I was a bit confused with the point of the last issue, but now I understand it was to expand on Selina's backstory. Looking forward to getting back to the main story in this one.
- **Daredevil #611**- My LCS didn't have any extras of #610, so I'm a bit behind here.
- **Fantastic Four #3**- Delays, delays! The last issue we got was in September. I really want to like this series, but I may drop after this first arc.
- **Oblivion Song #9** - Here's the one I'm looking forward to the most! Robert Kirkman is telling a really cool story! If you're not reading _Oblivion Song_, definitely give it a try.
- **Uncanny X-Men #1** - I love Tom Taylor's _X-Men: Red_ so much that I kind of resent this new series. But Kelly Thompson is involved, and I love her work.
- **Wonder Woman #58** - New creative team! G. Willow Wilson is the new writer, so I'm really hoping this is a _Wonder Woman_ run I can get into. Also, really want [the Jenny Frison variant](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/6373462/wonder-woman-58?variant=4993135).
