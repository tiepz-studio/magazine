Every Wednesday, new comic books hit the shelves with new stories to be engrossed in, and new art to be fascinated by. This is my weekly write-up where I share what comic books I read last week, and [my pull list](/topics/#pull-list) of comics for this week.

## What I read last week

{% include h-rating.html text="Fantastic Four #5" rating=5 level=3 url="https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim/reviews/989393/fantastic-four-5" %}

This is the Fantastic Four at their best. Don't get me wrong, I love the superhero stuff and fighting the bad guys as much as the next person, but the interpersonal relationships of the FF are so much more interesting. Dan Slott gives us some very special character moments in this issue (even a blast to the past) and I loved it. I was nervous about this wedding issue, but it didn't disappoint. It's the best one we've seen of this new run.

{% include h-rating.html text="Man-Eaters #4" url="https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim/reviews/985589/man-eaters-4" rating=4 %}

Creator-owned comics are my favorite. Issues like this are the reason why. The whole comic is formatted as a fake magazine, and I loved every moment. The jokes are well done, and the amount of work put in to make this look _just the right amount of real_ made me laugh.

**Favorite of the week:** Fantastic Four #5

## Picking up this week

- **Deadpool #8** - Skottie Young isn't doing the typical 4-6 issue arc, and I'm enjoying it a lot. It offers the opportunity for some pretty cool self-contained stories.
- **Star Wars: Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi #1** - I'm bummed these are all one-offs. I'd love a maxi-series on almost all of the characters they're doing an issue on.
