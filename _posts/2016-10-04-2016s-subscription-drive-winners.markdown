What an awesome week. I published the anniversary post last Monday, and we had quite a few new people visit the site and subscribe. Thank you! We've got some great stuff publishing soon.

## The Winners

- **Jonathan Simcoe** - Spider-Man Box
- **Guy Routledge** - Coffee Box
- **Kate McGee** - Creative Box

I've sent an email or Twitter Direct Message to let these fortunate peeps know. If I don't get a response within 5 days, I'll just pick another name at random.

## Thank You

Again, thank you all for reading the site. Thanks to all of you who shared our anniversary post, subscribed, and celebrated with us. Hope you're having a great day, and now back to our regular programming.
