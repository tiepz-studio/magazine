This is why I love Marco Arment. It happens to be the reason he's also very successful. He trusts his gut, which I think is one of the most difficult things to learn how to do.

Marco isn't given enough credit as a designer. He may not create the visuals for all of his products, but he is very deliberate with his design decisions. Can't wait for this app.
