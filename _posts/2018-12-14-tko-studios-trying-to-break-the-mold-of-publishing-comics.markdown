TKO Studios, a publisher I'd never heard of until recently [on The Outhouse](http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/141655-tko-studios-is-trying-to-be-a-modern-comic-book-company.html) is trying something different in the comics publishing industry. [From their Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TKOpresents/status/1072261846688653312):

> We know fans donâ€™t want to wait months to read a full story. So we BINGE-RELEASE our books. We make all issues of a single miniseries available at once.

Netflix popularized this idea of binging content, and now that's coming to comics. I love sitting down to read a whole story arc at once. But just because they're releasing a complete story all at once doesn't mean you have less choices in format. [In that same Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/TKOpresents/status/1072261853290487808), TKO explains that all of their books will come out in three different formats.

For those of us who love to collect single issues, TKO will release a six-issue set complete with an awesome looking collectors box. If you're a fan of trade paperbacks (which I also happen to love), TKO is making those too. And to cover all their bases, there are digital options too. [Which they're saying](https://twitter.com/TKOpresents/status/1072261865093312513) will be available on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

From the images, it looks like they've paid attention to the details. They've got several books for sale already [on the site](https://tkopresents.com/), others are available for pre-order. You can access the site with the password `vipaccess`. I'm excited to see if this experiment works.
