Today is an exciting day. My friends, Stephen Hackett and Myke Hurley, have announced their new project: [Relay FM](http://relay.fm).

Relay FM is their new network, that will house some of their classic shows, and a few new ones. I for one, am very excited for them. My sentiments align very much with [Chris'](http://www.chrisenns.com/2014/08/relay-fm/):

> In as much as some­one might think a new pod­cast net­work would be bad and add com­pe­ti­tion to [what I’m work­ing on](http://goodstuff.fm/), it’s really not the case. Pod­cast­ing needs to become more famil­iar to more peo­ple so that we all rise together. And the only way that’s going to hap­pen is by hav­ing qual­ity pod­casts that draw peo­ple in to the medium.

I think this new addition to the podcasting landscape is great for us as a whole. And really, the shows Myke and Stephen work on can't really be called "new". It's more of a continuation of the amazing work they've already been doing.

Also, I'm incredibly excited that Relay FM is powered by the CMS that [Will Duffy](https://twitter.com/willmanduffy) and I created. The fact that we got to work on a project like this is beyond awesome.

With that said, do your ears a favor, and follow the happenings of Relay FM. It'll be some *goodstuff™*.
