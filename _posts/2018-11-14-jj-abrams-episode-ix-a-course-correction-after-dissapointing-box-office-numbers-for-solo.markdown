[L.D. Nolan reporting for *CBR*](https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-episode-ix-course-correction/):

> A new report indicates that Lucasfilm hopes *Star Wars: Episode IX* will put the franchise back on the right track after a disappointing box office haul for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*.

> *Solo* only earned a little over $392 million worldwide upon its release in May. The film is currently the least successful in the history of the *Star Wars* franchise and may have [lost Disney over $50 million](https://www.cbr.com/solo-star-wars-50-million-loss-disney/). Alden Ehrenreich, the actor who plays Solo in the film, is [signed on for three films with Disney](https://www.cbr.com/solo-alden-ehrenreich-three-movie-deal-lucasfilm/), which means he could still return to the role in some capacity in other spinoff films set during that time period. However, *Solo* itself is [unlikely to get a sequel](https://www.cbr.com/solo-sequel-unlikely/).

While *Solo* wasn't an exceptional film, it was *still good*. I enjoyed it a lot more than *Rogue One*. It's not fair to judge a film so harshly when the original directors left, and [Ron Howard proceeded to reshoot most of the film](https://www.cbr.com/han-solo-ron-howard-reshoots/).

I should add, assigning J.J. Abrams to put *Star Wars* back on the right track is a disappointing strategy. For the life of me, I can't find the link of where I said it, but J.J. is the safe bet. And that's no disrespect to the spectacular job he did rebooting this favorite franchise of mine. But after [Rian Johnson's wonderful and different *The Last Jedi*](/2017/12/my-brief-review-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi/), I wanted more of that.

One thing is for sure, I don't envy Kathleen Kennedy's job. *Star Wars* fans are hard to please.
