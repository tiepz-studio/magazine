> In many ways, this f.lux/Night Shift thing is pretty similar to other examples of Apple moving into a space defined by a third-party utility: Reading List vs. Instapaper; Dashboard vs. Konfabulator; Sherlock vs. Watson.

Stephen went way too easy on Apple here. What they’re doing with this whole Night Shift thing is appalling. Not only did they steal—yea, that’s right, *steal*—an idea from one of their third-party developers, f.lux can’t even operate on iOS.

This is ridiculous. Apple needs to allow it on iOS. I don’t care if this stunt helps f.lux in the long run, *it’s ethically wrong*. This type of—what feels like a scheme of some sort—discourages developers from their platform.
