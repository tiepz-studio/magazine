Stephen Hackett writes a concise review of Bartender, and why it's *The Sweet Setup's* best app for keeping the menu bar organized.

I'm a huge fan of [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/). Because I normally prefer menu bar apps, things can get cluttered pretty easily, and as Stephen points out, there are some that you don't need to monitor 24/7.
