Another exciting week of comics is here! It's a little different than usual since by the time you're reading this, I'll be in London, England. Since I'm away from home, I won't be picking anything up this week, but here's what I read last week.

## What I read last week

- **Cover #2**  
  I'm loving this book! Brian Michael Bendis is setting up an intriguing story, and this particular issue's subtext has some scathing critique of our society. Once again, David Mack's art is nothing short of superb.
- **Daredevil #609**  
  This is part one of "The Death of Daredevil". I've been wanting to get back into reading Daredevil so what better than his final arc. Phil Noto's art is spectacular as usual, but what I was most impressed by were the colors. I'm so used to Netflix _Daredevil_ that these bright and beautiful colors were a nice change.
- **The New World #4**  
  A bit confused as to what's going on here.
- **Shuri #1**  
  Sadly, I didn't like this as much as I was hoping to. The writing was a bit boring (although the ending was intriguing), and the art on the inside was cartoonish and drawn as if for a comic geared towards children. The only positive thing I have to say is that the cover is spectacular with a crazy amount of detail and dazzling colors.
- **Saga Vol. 8 Trade Paperback**  
  This volume interestingly opens up by giving us a recap of the story and what's happening, which makes me wonder what was going on around the release of these issues. Brian K. Vaughan delivers another solid volume of _Saga_ with more killer art from Fiona Staples. While there's a lot of humor in the series, there are also many moments that leave you worried and anxious. This volume however, surprisingly ends on a happy note which is a pleasant change.

**Favorite of the week:** Cover #2
