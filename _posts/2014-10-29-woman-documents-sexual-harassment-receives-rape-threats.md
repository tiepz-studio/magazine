Cory Doctorow reporting for *Boing Boing*:

> Shoshana B Roberts spent 10 hours walking the streets of New York with a hidden camera crew, documenting over 100 catcalls (plus countless less-visible forms of harassment), as part of a campaign from Hollaback, who work to fight street harassment of women.
>
> Within a day, she had over a million views -- and a totally predictable passel of rape-threats from creeps.

This is sad. The ensuing rape threats are not only utterly disgusting, they further prove the necessity for awareness on street harassment. Cat calling is not a compliment. The never ending focus on the female appearance is a problem that transcends our industry, and each of us can do our part in being respectful.
