[Hoai-Tran Bui writing for _/Film_](https://www.slashfilm.com/chris-evans-captain-america-not-done-russo-brothers/):

> Evans is not signed up for any films past _Avengers 4_, and much hoopla has been made about the a new era of the [MCU](https://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-characters-futures/) after the events of _Avengers: Infinity War_ and the still-untitled _Avengers 4_. But perhaps Russo is hinting that while Evans will no longer play the role onscreen, heâ€™ll still be involved in the _Captain America_ series in some capacity? Like as a director, perhaps?

This is so tough. As a fan, I'd love to see Chris Evans play Captain America forever. Would I love to see him stay to direct a _Captain America_ film? Hell yea.

But as a creative person, I see the other perspective. No one wants to be boxed in creatively. As fun as being part of the MCU is (lest we forget lucrative), filming these movies is incredibly time consuming, leaving little time for other projects.

Interestingly, the source material makes these type of transitions difficult too. DC and Marvel are notorious for killing and resurrecting characters, giving them endless backstory. <mark>While Captain America has lived in comic books for decades without aging, it doesn't translate to the real people playing these&nbsp;heroes.</mark>
