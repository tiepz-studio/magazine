Shivan Kaul Sahib describes his second round interview at Amazon:

> My second round interview involved me being on line with a proctor (from [ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/)), whose job was to provide tech support and make sure I don’t cheat. As preamble, the proctor made me download some software, one of which spun up a UI for chatting with the proctor and giving them access to my machine so they can take control of *my entire computer, including mouse*. The proctor then proceeded to shut down all my running applications for me (I never realized what an unnerving experience it is to see your mouse move on your screen under someone else’s bidding). Then, my system settings were messed around with to make sure I can’t take screenshots. Of course, my camera and microphone are taken control of as well.

> After similarly Big Brother’ing around for a while, I’m asked to raise my laptop and show my desk through the webcam, which I do. At this point I was told:
>
> *“Clean your desk.”*

What?! I can't even. Hiring in tech is completely and utterly messed up.
