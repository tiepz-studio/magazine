Manton Reece:

> Now if only more indie developers would speak out about this, maybe we’d make some progress with Apple. As I’ve said many times: 15% for paid downloads and in-app purchase is reasonable for the value that Apple provides.

I'm happy to see Spotify take a stand for this, but as Manton points out, we'll have to wait and see how they treat podcasts after their acquisitions of Gimlet and Anchor to see if they genuinely believe this, or if they just don't like when it applies to them.

Either way, the issue is a serious one. I've thought a lot about this recently as I build Bokeh. Bokeh will only have paid accounts, and as a new business, it's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that Apple will take 30% of each subscription. But then <mark>I worry about all the business we may miss out on by—essentially—making it more difficult for people to create an account and pay us due to Apple's stupid rules around what you can and can't&nbsp;say.</mark>

Apple needs to fix this.
