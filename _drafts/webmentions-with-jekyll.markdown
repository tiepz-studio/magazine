I haven't had comments on my blog since my WordPress days. Having a static site meant that there wasn't native commenting support. The fallback was often bloated JavaScript with something like Disqus, which I never really liked because the comments then belong to them and not *your* site.

Also, let's not forget that one of the most common sayings online is, "Don't read the comments." Anonymity has given the worst of people the ability to say horrible things without any feeling of responsibility. The mask of anonymity has made it abundantly clear: people will say horrific things when their name isn't attached to what's being said.

Unfortunately, that's made discussion on blogs difficult; one-way streets where the writer has much to say, but they never hear from those who read. Or at least that's how it has felt for me.

I wanted desperately to change that, and that's why I've added support for webmentions to this blog. I don't think of the pieces on here as a monologue, but instead the start of a dialogue with you. Until now, that discussion would often happen on Twitter.

Webmentions are part of the open web. They allow us to reply, like, share, repost, even RSVP straight from your website together with the use of microformats. Webmentions are so much better than comments. Not only do they allow for more flexibility, they attach the words to the author.

Just as a caveat, these are instructions for how to do it with Jekyll. Keith J. Grant has a great walkthrough on how to do it with Hugo, and here's how to do it with Eleventy.
