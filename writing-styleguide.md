I can be a very forgetful person. Case in point, I tend to forget my personal rules and guidelines for my writing. Hence, here's a written guide for me to reference when I need it.

## Personality and Tone

Articles and commentary on links written by me, should sound like me. My personality and tone is:

- Happy
- Friendly
- Opinionated
- Sarcastic (at times)

When writing, I use proper grammar and language, but I ain't afraid of no slang when appropriate. I don't use swear words.

## Spelling

I spell out numbers up to 100 (e.g. ninety-six), as well as large round numbers (e.g. two thousand). Numbers in post titles or headings shouldn't be spelled out.

For percentages, I use numerals and spell out “percent” (e.g. 20 percent).

This site always uses the American spelling (e.g. favorite, color, etc.). Non-English words follow the respective language spelling rules (e.g. niño, café, etc.).

## Titles

Titles, headings, and subheadings, use "title case," which means:

- Capitalizing all words except coordinate conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), articles, and prepositions
- First and last word capitalized, no matter their parts of speech

When titles, headings, and subheadings have filenames or other types of code, they don't use the `<code>` tag.

Titles of movies, TV shows, periodicals, newspapers, books, and other publications are italicized. The article is only italicized if it's part of the name of the publication (e.g. the *Wirecutter*, *The Brooks Review*).

Poems, songs, and TV episodes take quotation marks.

## Punctuation

Quotation marks should:

- Follow periods and commas (“x.” and “x,”)
- Precede colons and semicolons (“x”: and “x”;)
- Precede question marks and exclamation marks, unless those marks are part of the quoted material

I believe in the serial comma (e.g. bread, peanut butter, and jelly). The comma always goes before the conjunction in a series.

A period is followed by a single space. I use regular dashes (-) for hyphenated compound words (e.g. long-term, mother-in-law). En dashes (–) are used for ranges (e.g. 2013–2017). Em dashes (—) are most common as more aggressive parentheses.

## Other Writing Stuff

Blockquotes are used for quotes that are longer than one sentence. I hardly use semi-colons (mostly because I don't understand them all the time). Paragraphs should be no longer than 6–7 sentences. I like paragraphs to look a certain way, and for the most part I loathe back-to-back single-sentence paragraphs.

Footnotes are generally avoided unless the tangent provides context to the rest of the piece.[^piece] Links shouldn't have punctuation unless the circumstance calls for it (e.g [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/)).

Commands (e.g. `bundle install`), filenames (e.g. `index.html`), and parts that belong to a language syntax (e.g. `:not()` or `minmax()`) should use `<code>`.

[^piece]: This for example wouldn't qualify. This doesn't add anything to the writing style guide. These are just words that mean nothing. UGH!!
