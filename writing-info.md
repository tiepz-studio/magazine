## Getting Setup

If you want to run the site on your local machine, here are the steps to follow.

### Install the Right Version of Ruby

The site currently runs on Ruby `2.3.0`. I recommend using [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your Ruby versions. [Here are step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-macos) to install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Clone the Repo

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:smithtimmytim/brightpixels.blog.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

### Start Your Server

```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --limit_posts 10 -o
```

Voilà!

## Writing Article Posts

Include the following information in the YAML front matter when you want to write an article post:

```yaml
custom_type: post
title: 'A Brief Review of ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’'
# The subtitle is optional, but I usually re-
# commend adding one
subtitle: The latest of the Star Wars saga films is a fresh, new, and exciting chapter of my favorite franchise
# Please visit the Topics page when adding
# tags. Add tags in lowercase unless
# necessary for the tag
tags: [apple, iPhone, NBA, development]
date: 2018-01-02 22:12 # Publish date in central timezone
```

### Code Samples

Code is written with GitHub Formatted Markdown.

    ```yaml
    review:
      type: movie
      rating: 2.5 # Numbers that are supported are 1-5 and their .5 intervals
    ```

### Images

Use the `<figure>` element for images.

```html
{% raw %}
<figure class="extendout">
  {% include_cached img.html src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Alt text here" %}
  <figcaption>Caption here</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endraw %}
```

You can find possible photo grid options on the [Style Guide](/styleguide). It'll look something like this:

```html
{% raw %}
<figure class="photo-grid photo-grid--three">
  {% include_cached img.html src="/2017/12/family-at-the-fair.jpg" alt="Family at the
  Fair" %}
  {% include_cached img.html src="/2017/12/dawson.jpg" alt="Dawson" %}
  {% include_cached img.html src="/2017/12/friends-at-the-cabin.jpg" alt="Friends at the Cabin" %}
  <figcaption>Caption for the images goes here</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endraw %}
```

Please put your images in the `uploads` folder. Use the year and month folder that corresponds to the year and month you're publishing in. If not already created, create them. When creating a month folder, always use a leading zero (e.g. `03` for March).

## Writing Link Posts

When writing link posts, include the following YAML front matter:

```yaml
custom_type: link
title: How Apple Watch Saved One Man’s Life — and How It’s Empowering Him After His Heart Attack | 9to5Mac
# URL you're linking to
link_url: https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/15/apple-watch-saves-life-managing-heart-attack/
# Please visit the Topics page when adding
# tags. Add tags in lowercase unless
# necessary for the tag
tags: [apple, iPhone, NBA, development]
date: 2018-01-02 22:12 # Publish date in central timezone
```

When linking to an article, use the headline of the article with a pipe and the name of the site:

```yaml
title: How Apple Watch Saved One Man’s Life — and How It’s Empowering Him After His Heart Attack | 9to5Mac
```

If the article was written on a personal blog that has no name, then use the headline of the article and attribute the name of the person:

```yaml
title: A Sticky Situation by Ethan Marcotte
```
